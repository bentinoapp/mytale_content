Defne and the Window of the Heart

Once upon a time, in a village where everyone greeted one another, birds traced circles in the sky, and children’s laughter echoed through the streets, there lived a child named Defne.

Defne was sensitive, but usually that sensitivity only arose for things they could see and recognize. They wanted to help those who were in pain, those who felt sorrow, those who cried—but they couldn’t understand one thing:

“Why do some people shut themselves away? Why do they stay silent and not speak?”
To Defne, emotions were straightforward: when you’re happy you laugh, when you’re sad you say so. But some classmates at school sat in silence, and Defne found that puzzling. If they said nothing, Defne assumed they didn’t want anyone’s attention—and often didn’t even ask, “How are you?”

One day a new student arrived in class. Their name was Rüzgar. Rüzgar never spoke. They didn’t join games at recess, nor did they raise a hand in lessons. Defne sat beside them once or twice but gave up when there was no reply.

“If they don’t speak, they must not want attention,” Defne thought.
Yet something gnawed at Defne’s heart. There was a silent plea in Rüzgar’s eyes—but ears alone could not hear it.

That evening, Defne sat at their desk in quiet solitude when the pages of their notebook began to turn by themselves. From one page emerged a thin, golden line that drifted upward, curling through the air until it formed a window frame.

Above the frame, tiny letters appeared:

“Window of the Heart: Opens for those who wish to hear the unheard, who long to see the unseen.”
Defne’s fingers reached out to the glass. It misted over, then cleared. They closed their eyes—and when they opened them again, they were no longer in their room.

They found themselves in a world silent yet bursting with color. The sky was a single shade between purple and blue. There was no sound, yet everything seemed to have something to say. Then a figure appeared—neither child nor adult, neither woman nor man, both familiar and strange.

“This is the inner realm of the Window of the Heart,” said the figure.
“Anyone who enters must learn to see compassion not only with their eyes but with their heart.”
Defne listened attentively.

“I just… want to understand. Those who stay silent, who do not speak…”
The figure nodded.

“Then be ready to open three windows. Each reveals another heart. But only those who truly feel, not merely see, can understand.”
Defne nodded.

“I am ready.”
First Window: The Thorny Garden

The first window revealed a garden overrun with thorns. In the center stood a small child, encircled by brambles. No one approached; everyone watched from afar.

One child shouted:

“They’re always scowling—let them be!”
Another called:

“Like a cactus—who’d want to get close?”
At first Defne hesitated. Then they realized the thorns sprang from the child’s pain, woven from their life experience.

Slowly, Defne stepped forward and gently touched a thorn. It pricked their finger. Still, they didn’t withdraw.

“I want to come closer,” they said. “It may hurt me—but I’ll bear it.”
The child looked up. For the first time, their eyes met. The thorns began to fall away.

The figure reappeared:

“Compassion is seeing not only the one in pain but also the one who inflicts it. Sometimes those who hurt most have themselves been wounded deepest.”
Second Window: The Silent Room

The second window opened onto a dark, soft room. In one corner sat a child, knees hugged close, head bowed. The walls echoed—but there was no sound.

Defne tiptoed closer.

“Why are you silent?” they wanted to ask—then stopped. Instead, they sat beside the child, sharing the quiet.
Time passed. The room’s darkness gently brightened. The child lifted their head. They weren’t crying, nor smiling—but they were no longer alone.

A whisper from the figure:

“Compassion sometimes means not speaking, but staying by someone’s side. Those whose hearts are silent need presence more than words.”
Third Window: The Mirror City

The final window showed a city of mirrors. Everyone stared at their own reflection, never at each other. The streets gleamed, but each person was alone in the pursuit of looking good.

Someone handed Defne a mirror:

“Look at yourself! See how you shine!”
Defne gazed at their radiant reflection—but all around, other reflections were pale, unnoticed.

Then a faint reflection winked. It was Rüzgar’s—fragile but there.

Defne set the mirror down:

“I don’t want to look at myself anymore. I want to look for Rüzgar. I want to notice them.”
Mirrors cracked. Walls melted away. A rainbow rain fell from the sky. People turned to face one another, their faces alight.

The figure stepped close:

“Compassion is not only seeing pain, but noticing what’s hidden. It’s being willing to let go of yourself. You have opened this final window.”
Defne opened their eyes to find themselves back in their own room. They glanced out the window—there was Rüzgar, quietly sitting in the schoolyard garden.

The next morning, on the way to school, Defne went straight to Rüzgar’s side.

“Hello,” Defne said softly.
No words came, but Rüzgar lifted their head slightly.

At recess they sat together in silence—just being together. Then, one day, Rüzgar handed Defne a small slip of paper that read:

“For the first time, someone stayed with me without needing me to speak.”
From that day on, Defne paid more attention to what people didn’t say. They noticed eyes that cried in stillness and hearts that hid sorrow. And they never again asked, “Why aren’t you talking?”

Because they understood at last:

True compassion is the voice of the heart that reaches beyond words.
