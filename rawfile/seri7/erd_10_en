Defne and the Mirror of Truth

Once upon a time, in a town where the sky rose a different color each morning, the trees danced with the wind, and people’s eyes could smile at one another, there lived a child named Defne.

Defne loved a certain saying dearly:

“I won’t tell a lie, but I don’t have to tell everything, do I?”
This motto often led Defne to dodge questions or remain silent, concealing the whole truth. To Defne, lying and withholding were two different things.

The Stolen Sketch
One day, the school held an art contest—everyone had to submit their own original work. Defne was eager at first, but no matter how hard they tried, the perfect picture wouldn’t emerge. Then, when a classmate named Aiden (who’d forgotten his bag) left behind his sketchbook, Defne glanced inside and saw exactly the forest scene they’d been imagining: trees reflecting on water, birds dancing in the sky. Beneath the drawing was a note:

“Can’t wait to finish this. I’m going to win this time.”
Defne stared at it and thought, “If I tweak it a bit… no one will notice. Besides, he left it here.”

On contest day, Defne submitted Aiden’s drawing with small changes. The teachers were amazed by the color, composition, and emotion. Though uneasy inside, Defne said nothing.

That afternoon, the winner was announced. The prize went to Defne.

Applause filled the room. Defne accepted the award and even gave a short speech—but felt a hollow ache inside. That night, Defne couldn’t sleep.

The Message on the Window
At midnight, a soft glow woke Defne. The window had fogged, and a sentence appeared:

“Honesty is not just telling the truth, but standing up to the truth itself.”
As Defne approached, a point of light formed in the glass. It grew into a rippling mirror—more like water than glass.

When Defne touched it, the surface shifted like mist. Everything spun.

Defne closed their eyes—and upon reopening them, stood in a new realm.

The Realm of Truths
Here, the sky was translucent. People’s hearts were visible—not in words, but in colors: green for calm, red for anger, yellow for envy, purple for regret—and white for honesty above all.

Ahead, a figure in a clear cloak appeared, their voice calm yet seeing straight into Defne’s heart.

“Welcome, Defne. This is the Realm of Truths. Anyone who enters must face their own reflection.”
Defne inhaled deeply.

“I… technically didn’t lie, but I hid the truth.”
“We know,” said the figure. “Truth isn’t only in words. It begins in the heart and is fulfilled by our actions.”
First Task: The Silent Chest

Defne found themself in a plaza with a chest inscribed:

“You carry here every truth you’ve hidden. It takes courage to open.”
Inside lay scraps of paper, each bearing a familiar sentence:

“I only copied a little.”
“No one saw me.”
“I deserved a little advantage.”
Seeing those words, Defne felt shame—they recognized each as an excuse they’d once made.

A voice intoned:

“Honesty isn’t just speaking your deeds; it’s owning them.”
Defne closed the lid, then placed a new note atop:

“It was mine.”
The chest glowed and vanished.

Second Task: The Colored Shadows

Defne walked down a long corridor lined with mirrors, each reflection showing a different emotion—some smiling, some fearful, some angry, some joyful. But one figure stood frozen, eyes darting away.

Defne approached.

“Who are you?”
The silent reflection replied:

“I am the part of you that cannot be honest with yourself. You pushed me down, yet here I remain.”
Defne fell silent. Then their eyes locked. A single tear fell from the reflection—and at the very same moment, by some uncanny magic, a tear appeared on Defne’s own cheek.

The reflection smiled softly.

“When you accept me, you draw closer to honesty.”
Light flooded the mirrors. All reflections merged into one unified image.

Third Task: The Path of Truth

Finally, Defne emerged onto a path bearing a sign:

“There is no easy way to speak truth—yet it alone leads to peace.”
As they walked, the path split. A figure stepped out—it was Defne themself, holding the contest trophy, smiling but with sorrow in their eyes.

“Return now, and the prize remains,” said the figure.
“Stay the course, and peace escapes you.”
Defne hesitated, recalling the applause, the teachers’ admiration… then Aiden’s notebook, his note, his dream—and most of all, their own heart.

Defne turned away and walked toward the other fork. Trees lined the way, nodding gently. The sky cleared.

Once more the figure appeared.

“You have faced your mirror. Now go, and take your truth with you.”
They handed Defne a small hand mirror inscribed:

“Each truth you confront makes you who you are.”
The Dawn of Confession
Defne opened their eyes to find themselves back in bed. Dawn’s light streamed through the window.

At school that morning, Defne approached the teacher, then Aiden, then the front of the class.

“I was declared the winner, but that drawing wasn’t mine. I was wrong. I need to tell the truth.”
The room fell silent. The teacher removed their glasses and offered a nod. Aiden’s eyes shimmered—but no one shouted or condemned. The truth simply hung in the air.

The teacher said quietly:

“Speaking truth is greater than any prize. Today, honesty wins.”
Defne looked into the hand mirror in their pocket. The glass no longer gleamed, but the reflection was perfectly clear—and completely true.

That day, Defne gained nothing—but for the first time felt utterly at peace.

And whenever the easier path beckoned, Defne would touch the mirror in their pocket and remember its cool weight:

“Honesty is not just speaking what’s right, but choosing what’s right.”
