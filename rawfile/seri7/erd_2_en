Defne and the Scales of Justice

Once upon a time—in a city much like ours, where parks echoed with joyful laughter and sidewalks held chalk‑drawn skies—lived a seven‑year‑old child named Defne. Defne’s eyes were wide with wonder, curiosity boundless, and imagination soaring beyond the clouds. Their greatest passion was helping others and standing up for what is right. Yet sometimes… they acted too hastily. Whenever they saw something “wrong,” they would decide at once—sometimes landing themselves in trouble.

One Friday morning, Defne raced to school in excitement. Every Friday, their teacher, Ms. Zeynep, held the “Mysterious Treasure Game” in class. The special prize went to the student who had done the most good deeds, treated classmates with respect, and shown honesty all week.

That day, Ms. Zeynep entered the classroom carrying a glittering box.

“Children,” she said, “this week’s prize is something truly special—something that will fill the pages of your future…”

From the box she drew a golden, glittering notebook. On its cover, in large letters, were the words:
“Write Your Future!”

The children gazed in awe. The cover sparkled so brightly that it seemed to hum a melody when touched.

“I will award this to the one who has stood out in honesty and kindness,” said Ms. Zeynep. “But I will announce the winner after recess.”

Defne’s heart pounded. I hope it’s me, they thought. All week, they had tried their best: wiping the chalkboard, picking up fallen pencils, and speaking kindly to friends.

Recess began, and the children rushed out of the classroom. Defne went to the cafeteria. Five minutes later, when they returned… the box lay open—and the notebook was gone!

A cold knot formed in Defne’s stomach. Just then, they spotted Arda rummaging in his backpack in the back row. Arda was a quiet, shy boy who usually kept to himself and read books rather than play.

Defne’s eyes fixed on Arda’s open zipper—something golden was peeking out just like the missing notebook!

Without thinking, Defne burst into the hallway, found Ms. Zeynep, and cried,

“Teacher Zeynep! I found them! Arda took the notebook!”

Ms. Zeynep turned back to the classroom and looked at Arda as the other children trickled in. Arda’s face went chalk‑white.

“No, I didn’t! I swear I didn’t!” he protested.

Ms. Zeynep spoke calmly:

“Class, we must not accuse anyone without proof. Arda, would you open your bag?”

Hands trembling, Arda unzipped and pulled out… a golden water bottle.

Murmurs ran through the classroom. Defne’s face burned with shame. But I really thought it was the notebook… they whispered.

Ms. Zeynep stood silent for a moment, then bent down to look under the desk—and there lay the notebook, pushed aside as if accidentally.

“The notebook must have slipped here. No one stole it. But today we learned an important lesson,” she said.

Defne’s eyes filled with tears. So did Arda’s. The class fell silent.

On the way home, Defne’s heart was heavy. I wanted to stand for justice… but I was unjust, they thought.

That night, as Defne wrote in their diary, a small, silver object began to glow on the desk. It was a palm‑sized scale. On one pan was a heart symbol, on the other an eye. Across its base were the words:

“Justice is built not just by seeing, but by understanding.”

A sudden breeze swirled through the room, curtains fluttered, diary pages rustled. Eyes closed, Defne found themself transported to a strange place.

Towering columns rose all around under a sky that seemed too wary to judge. In the center stood a blindfolded figure holding a massive scale. It was the Queen of Justice!

“Defne,” the Queen’s voice rang, “today you learned how delicate justice can be. Yet your heart still seeks what is right. I grant you a second chance—a journey through time. Your mission: discover the truth and grasp the true meaning of justice.”

Defne nodded bravely.

“I’m ready!”

In an instant, they were back in the classroom—but everything was frozen in place. No student moved, no clock ticked. Only Defne could move.

Defne tiptoed through the desks to Arda’s backpack and saw clearly that the golden object was a water bottle, not the notebook.

What I saw was not the truth, they realized.

Then Defne crouched under their own desk. There lay the notebook exactly where it had fallen.

No one stole it, Defne murmured. Yet I judged at once…

At that moment, the blackboard wrote itself:

“The scales of justice lose balance through hasty judgments. Weigh what you see with your heart before you speak.”

Defne copied the words into their diary. Then lights flickered, and they were back in their room.

The silver scale still sat on the desk—this time perfectly balanced. The Queen’s voice whispered through the air:

“True justice lives in hearts that shed all prejudice…”

The next morning, Defne arrived at school early. Seeing Arda first, they ran over and said,

“Arda, I’m sorry. I was unfair. I believed only what I saw, and in doing so I hurt you…”

Arda hesitated, then smiled:

“I was upset too, but thank you for being honest.”

When Ms. Zeynep entered, Defne raised a hand:

“Teacher, I want to apologize to everyone for yesterday. What we see isn’t always the whole truth. We must think before we accuse.”

Ms. Zeynep smiled warmly:

“Defne has taught us all a lesson today. Justice is not just about finding the culprit—it is being patient and understanding in seeking the truth.”

The class applauded, and Ms. Zeynep presented the notebook to Defne—this time with a written note:

“Write in this book not what you have seen, but what you have learned.”

And that notebook became Defne’s most treasured journal, chronicling their journey toward justice. Somewhere in the heavens, the Queen of Justice, watching her scales, whispered:

“Another child has heard the voice within…”

And though this tale ends here, Defne’s journey in justice began anew each day with every small choice.
