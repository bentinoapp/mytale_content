Defne and the Scales of Justice

Once upon a time—in a town much like ours, where parks rang with children’s laughter and sidewalks were painted with chalked-on skies—lived a seven‑year‑old girl named Defne. Defne had wide, curious eyes, an imagination that soared beyond the clouds, and a heart set on helping others and defending what was right. Yet sometimes she rushed to judgment: whenever she saw something “wrong,” she decided at once—and that sometimes caused trouble.

The Weekly Mystery Treasure Hunt
One Friday morning, Defne raced to school, excited for the weekly Mystery Treasure Hunt that her teacher, Ms. Robinson, held every Friday. The prize went to the student who had performed the most acts of kindness, shown respect to classmates, and behaved most honestly that week.

That day, Ms. Robinson entered the room carrying a glittering box.

“Children,” she announced, “this week’s prize is something truly special—something to fill the pages of your future…”

From the box she withdrew a golden, sparkling notebook. On the cover, in large letters, it read:
“Write Your Future!”

The students gazed in awe. The cover shimmered so brightly it seemed to sing a melody when touched.

“I will award this notebook to the child who has stood out for honesty and generosity,” said Ms. Robinson. “I will announce the winner after recess.”

Defne’s heart pounded. Please let it be me, she thought. All week she had wiped the chalkboard, collected pencils, and offered kind words to every classmate.

A Shock at Recess
When recess began, the children poured out of the classroom. Defne went to the lunch line, and five minutes later returned—only to find the box open and the notebook gone!

Her chest turned cold. She glanced back and saw Kevin, a quiet boy who usually read rather than played, digging through his backpack. A flash of gold peeked out—just like the missing notebook.

Without thinking, Defne ran into the hallway and found Ms. Robinson:

“Ms. Robinson! I found it—Kevin took the notebook!”

Ms. Robinson calmly followed her in, eyes on Kevin, whose face had gone pale. Slowly the other students drifted back inside.

“No, I didn’t! I swear I didn’t!” Kevin protested.

Ms. Robinson spoke gently:

“Class, we mustn’t accuse anyone without proof. Kevin, would you please open your backpack?”

Kevin unzipped it with shaking hands—and pulled out… a golden water bottle.

A murmur went through the room. Defne’s cheeks burned. But I really thought it was the notebook… she whispered to herself.

Ms. Robinson paused, then knelt and looked under Defne’s desk, retrieving the notebook that had slid there by accident.

“The notebook was right here. No one stole it. But today we’ve learned an important lesson.”

Defne’s eyes filled with tears, and so did Kevin’s. The classroom fell silent.

A Midnight Visitor
On the way home, Defne’s heart felt heavy. I wanted to uphold justice… but I judged unfairly, she thought. That night, as she wrote in her diary, a small silver scale appeared on her desk. On one pan was a heart symbol; on the other, an eye. Across the base were the words:

“Justice is built not only by what you see, but by what you understand.”

A sudden breeze fluttered the curtains, the diary pages rustled, and Defne closed her eyes. When she opened them, she stood in a strange, silent hall of towering columns. In its center stood a blindfolded figure holding a massive scale: the Queen of Justice.

“Defne,” the Queen’s voice echoed, “today you learned how delicate justice can be. Yet your heart still seeks the truth. I grant you one more chance: travel through time to discover the real facts and learn the true meaning of justice.”

Defne nodded bravely.

“I’m ready!”

In an instant, she was back in the classroom—but everything was frozen. No student moved; the clock’s hands were still. Only Defne could walk about.

The Time‑Frozen Lesson
Defne tiptoed to Kevin’s backpack and saw for herself that the golden object was indeed a water bottle, not the notebook.

What I saw was not the truth, she realized.

Next she crouched under her own desk. There lay the notebook, having slid out of sight.

No one stole it… yet I hastily blamed Kevin, she murmured.

At that moment, words appeared on the blackboard:

“The scales of justice lose balance with hasty judgments. Weigh what you see with your heart before you speak.”

Defne wrote the message into her diary. A flash of light whisked her back to her room. The silver scale still stood on the desk, now perfectly balanced. The Queen’s voice whispered in her mind:

“True justice resides in hearts free of prejudice…”

A New Beginning
The next morning, Defne arrived at school early. Seeing Kevin first, she ran over and said:

“Kevin, I’m so sorry. I judged you too quickly. I believed only what I saw, and I hurt you…”

Kevin hesitated, then smiled gently:

“I was upset too, but thank you for telling the truth.”

When Ms. Robinson entered, Defne raised her hand:

“Ms. Robinson, I’d like to apologize to everyone for yesterday. What we see isn’t always the whole story. We should think carefully before we accuse.”

Ms. Robinson beamed with pride:

“Defne has taught us all a valuable lesson today. Justice isn’t just about finding the guilty—it’s about seeking the truth with patience and understanding.”

The class applauded, and Ms. Robinson handed the notebook to Defne—with one added note:

“In this notebook, write not just what you saw, but what you learned.”

And that notebook became Defne’s most treasured possession, chronicling her journey toward true justice. Somewhere in the heavens, the Queen of Justice looked at her balanced scales and whispered:

“Another child has listened to the voice within…”

And though our tale ends here, Defne’s journey in justice began anew each day with every small choice she made.
