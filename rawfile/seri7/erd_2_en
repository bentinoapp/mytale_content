Defne and the Scales of Justice

Once upon a time—not in a far‑off realm but in a city much like the one you know, where laughter echoes across playgrounds and children draw the sky with chalk on sidewalks—there lived a seven‑year‑old named Defne.

Defne possessed wide, curious eyes, an imagination that stretched beyond the clouds, and an unwavering passion for helping others and standing up for what was right. Yet Defne often acted too hastily: the moment something seemed “wrong,” Defne drew a conclusion—and that impulse sometimes led into trouble.

One Friday morning, Defne bounded into school with excitement. Every Friday, Ms. Zoe organized the Mystery Treasure Game, awarding a special prize to the student who that week had shown the greatest kindness, respect, and honesty. Today’s reward lay inside a glittering box that Ms. Zoe held aloft before the class.

“Children,” announced Ms. Zoe, “this week’s prize is something truly magical—something that will fill the pages of your own future…”

From the box emerged a golden, glitter‑flecked journal. Across its cover, in bold letters, was written:

“Write Your Future!”

Every child gazed in wonder. The cover seemed to glow, and brushing a fingertip across it almost sounded like a soft melody.

“I will award this journal to the student who stands out for honesty and generosity,” Ms. Zoe continued, “but I’ll announce the winner after recess.”

Defne’s heart pounded. Surely, Defne thought, this time would be the one. All week long, Defne had cleaned the chalkboard, gathered up pencils that friends had dropped, and offered kind words to classmates.

When recess bell rang, the children poured out of the classroom, and Defne hurried to the cafeteria. Five minutes later, Defne returned to find the box open—and the journal gone.

A chill ran through Defne’s chest. At that moment, Defne spotted Aaron at the back of the room, rifling through his backpack. Aaron was the quiet child who rarely spoke in class, preferring to lose himself in books.

A glimpse of something golden hung from Aaron’s zipper—just like the journal!

Defne sprang to the door and found Ms. Zoe in the hallway.

“Ms. Zoe! I found it—Aaron took the journal!” Defne declared.

Ms. Zoe reentered the classroom, calm but curious. Students drifted back in.

Aaron’s face went pale.

“No! I swear I didn’t!” Aaron protested.

Ms. Zoe spoke gently:

“Children, we must never accuse anyone without proof. Aaron, would you please open your backpack?”

Aaron’s hands trembled as the pack unzipped. Inside lay only a gold‑colored water bottle.

Murmurs rippled through the class. Defne’s cheeks burned. “But I—I really thought it was the journal…” Defne muttered. Ms. Zoe paused.

Then Ms. Zoe knelt beside the box and retrieved the journal from beneath a desk.

“Look,” said Ms. Zoe. “The journal slipped under here. No one stole it—yet today we all learned something valuable.”

Defne’s eyes filled with tears. Aaron’s did too. Silence settled over the room.

Walking home that afternoon, Defne’s mind raced. I wanted to champion justice…but I was unfair, Defne reflected.

That night, as Defne began to write in a diary, a small, silvery object appeared atop the desk. It was a tiny scale—about the size of a hand—crafted in gleaming silver. On one pan was a heart symbol; on the other, an eye. Etched along the edge were the words:

“Justice is built not by seeing alone, but by understanding.”

A sudden whirlwind swept through the room: curtains billowed, pages fluttered. Closing eyes, Defne felt a shift—and then opened them to find a grand hall of towering columns, where even the sky seemed hesitant to decide its own hue. At the center stood a figure blindfolded and holding a gigantic scale.

It was the Queen of Justice.

“Defne,” the Queen intoned, “you have learned how fragile justice can be. Yet your spirit still seeks what is right. I grant you a second chance: embark on a journey through time. Your task is to uncover the truth and grasp the true meaning of justice.”

Defne nodded resolutely:

“I am ready.”

In an instant, Defne was back in the classroom—but all was frozen. Desks, chairs, even the ticking clock had paused. Only Defne could move.

Stepping quietly among the still figures, Defne approached Aaron’s backpack. That glinting object was clearly a water bottle, not the journal.

“What my eyes saw was not the whole truth,” Defne realized.

Bending down, Defne peered beneath a desk—and there lay the journal, as if someone had pushed it aside to hide it.

“No one stole it,” Defne whispered. “But I judged too quickly…”

At that moment, the blackboard’s chalk began to write on its own:

“The scales of justice lose balance with hasty decisions. Do not speak without weighing what you see with your heart.”

Defne carefully copied those words into the diary—then the lights flickered, and Defne found that silvery scale perched again on the desk, its heart and eye perfectly balanced. A soft voice, like a breeze, filled the room:

“True justice lives in hearts that have shed prejudice…”

The next morning, Defne arrived at school early and sought out Aaron.

“Aaron, I’m sorry,” Defne said. “I was wrong to accuse you. I believed only what I saw.”

Aaron hesitated, then offered a small smile:

“Thank you for telling the truth.”

When Ms. Zoe entered the classroom, Defne raised a hand.

“Teacher, I’d like to apologize to everyone for yesterday. What we see isn’t always the whole story. We must think before we accuse.”

Ms. Zoe smiled warmly.

“Today, Defne has taught us all: justice is not merely finding the guilty, but approaching truth with patience and understanding.”

The class applauded. Ms. Zoe presented the journal to Defne—with one final note:

“In this journal, write not what you have seen, but what you have learned.”

That journal remained Defne’s most treasured possession for years, filled with reflections on the journey toward true justice.

High above, the Queen of Justice gazed upon her scales and murmured:

“Another child has heard their inner voice…”

And though this tale ends here, Defne’s path of justice continues each day, one thoughtful choice at a time.
