Defne’s Magical Balance

Once upon a time …

In a neighborhood where the wind whispered with the leaves, cats danced on the rooftops, and people never forgot to greet each other with “good morning,” there lived a seven‑year‑old named Defne. Defne’s days overflowed with adventure, games, and questions.

Yet whenever enthusiasm spilled over, Mother would smile—or sometimes raise an eyebrow—and say:
“Defne, too much of anything can be harmful. Not too little, not too much … we have to stay in balance.”

Defne would nod, promise to remember, and the very next day eat too much chocolate, read for so long that lunch was forgotten, or chatter without taking a breath—because doing things most and more felt wonderful.

One afternoon, walking home from school, Defne spotted a strange little shop in the park—a place that had never been there before. Above the door a sign read:

“The Magical Setting for Everything — Open Today Only!”

In the window sat tiny bottles, pocket‑sized scales, hourglasses, and a single book titled “The Book of Balance.” Where a bell might hang, a miniature swing swayed gently in the breeze.

Defne’s heart raced.
“What a peculiar place,” they whispered, and curiosity pushed the door ajar.

Inside, the shop felt far larger than it looked. Shelves reached the ceiling, each holding a different tool for keeping balance. Suddenly a cheerful old man with a tall hat and round glasses appeared.

“Welcome, Defne,” he said. “I’m Mr. Poise, keeper of balances. I sense you’re a bit … out of tune.”

Defne blinked.
“How do you know my name? And what do you mean, out of tune?”

Smiling, Mr. Poise handed over a small card showing Defne’s balance score for the day:

Chocolate: 8 pieces (ideal: 2)
Talking: 146 words/min (ideal: 60)
Reading: 2 hours (ideal: 1)
Water: 1 glass (ideal: 6)

Defne’s mouth fell open.
“But none of those are bad!”

“Of course not,” Mr. Poise chuckled. “Yet too much shadow dims every good thing. I’ll make you an offer: take this magic hourglass. It holds the perfect timing for everything. But beware—if the sand ever flows backward, balance will break.”

After a moment’s thought, Defne accepted the hourglass. It was enchanting: golden sand above, silver sand below. Etched on the frame were the words:

“Not too little, not too much. Balance is life’s quietest miracle.”

Defne thanked Mr. Poise and went home.

The next morning felt entirely different.
— Only two slices of cake at breakfast.
— Just twenty minutes of cartoons, then off.
— While reading, Defne glanced at the hourglass and stopped right on time.

Mother stared in wonder.
“Today there’s a balanced Defne in front of me!” she laughed.

Yet a restlessness stirred inside.
“This is nice … but a little boring,” Defne thought.

After school Defne met friends in the park, hourglass in hand. They played hide‑and‑seek, ball, tag—each game ending exactly when the sand ran out. Still, Defne longed for more.

“Why does the hourglass decide? Why can’t I decide?” they muttered—and flipped it upside down.

The sand reversed. Golden grains climbed upward, and the world went dark. Children’s voices hushed, the wind froze, and when Defne rubbed their eyes, everything had changed.

This was the Land of Excess. Everything was too much. Trees towered so high the sky vanished. Cats were gigantic, milk flowed like waterfalls, and chocolate rained from above.

At first Defne cheered.
“This is amazing!”

Then …
— One bite of endless chocolate made a tooth ache.
— Talking puppets that never stopped gave a throbbing headache.
— A giant bookworm who read nonstop wore glasses so thick it could no longer see the words.

A weary child approached—hands sticky, eyes dull, teeth decayed.
“Here everything is endless,” the child sighed, “but nothing makes us happy.”

Defne gasped.
“But there are no limits!”

“That’s the problem,” the child said. “We flipped our hourglasses and lost the sense of when to stop. Even time feels insufficient now …”

Defne pulled out the hourglass. The sand had frozen.

A voice echoed through the air:
“Those who break balance disturb the rhythm of the universe.”

Fear gripped Defne. “I need to go home!” they cried. But no path appeared; fog swallowed everything.

Staring at the hourglass, Defne whispered:
“I didn’t want infinity. I only wanted to choose for myself. Now I see … finding balance doesn’t chain freedom. It makes true freedom possible.”

At that moment the sand began to flow again. The mist lifted—and Defne was back in the park. Friends stared.

“Defne, where did you drift off to?”

“Oh, nowhere … just thinking a bit too much,” Defne laughed.

From that day on the hourglass lived on the bedside table. Each morning Defne glanced at it—but listened first to the quiet compass inside their own heart.

One afternoon Mr. Poise reappeared.

“I hear you no longer rely on the hourglass,” he said.

“No,” Defne replied, “because I’ve grown an inner timer. When I lean toward ‘too much,’ it chimes softly.”

Mr. Poise beamed.
“Then the magic of balance is yours. You won’t speak too loudly nor sit in silence too long. You won’t eat beyond fullness nor stay hungry.”

Defne winked.
“And I won’t love so wildly that I forget myself, nor so little that I forget others. Everything is lovelier in just‑right measure.”

So Defne not only learned moderation—but began living it.

Somewhere in the sky, where cosmic hourglasses keep the universe in rhythm, another guardian etched a name in golden letters:

“The Child Who Grew with Balance: Defne.”

And from that day forward a delicate chime sounded within Defne’s heart:
Not too little, not too much—perfectly in‑between.
