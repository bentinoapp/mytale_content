In Pursuit of Time: Defne and the Hour of Patience

Once upon a time, in a small town where the morning sun bid farewell to misted windowpanes and the evening breeze played with curtains, there lived a child named Defne. Defne loved everything: reading, playing, listening, talking… but above all, they wanted everything to happen instantly.

They wished that when they planted seeds, flowers would bloom at once; that cakes would bake the moment they entered the oven; that whenever the teacher asked a question, they could answer immediately.

“Patience is so hard,” they would mutter. “Why must everything be so slow?”
Defne’s family would smile or arch an eyebrow and say:

“Time has its own language. It doesn’t speak quickly. It rewards those who listen patiently.”
But Defne couldn’t grasp this.

The Call of the Waiting Watch
One rainy afternoon, Defne dashed beneath a tree and noticed its trunk curled like a clock’s hands. Carved into the bark was a tiny nook. Peering inside, they saw an antique miniature watch inscribed with:

“Those who walk with time, not those who chase it, win.”
Defne reached out—and the watch sprang to life. Closing their eyes, they heard the wind hum—and when they opened them again, they stood somewhere entirely new.

The Realm of Time
This was the Land of Time, where clocks floated in the sky, grains of sand danced on the breeze, and drops of water hovered midair. Time here neither advanced nor rewound—it simply waited, as though to allow events to unfold.

Before them appeared a figure carrying a small bell of time on their shoulder. Their face was gentle, their eyes wise.

“Welcome,” the figure said. “Are you ready for the trial of patience?”
Defne exclaimed,

“I’m ready!”
But the figure shook their head:

“Readiness is easy to claim. Let us see if you can truly wait.”
And in that moment, three tasks appeared—each testing Defne’s patience.

Task One: The Waiting Seed

Defne found themselves in a vast, bountiful garden. A single seed lay in the soil beside a note:

“This flower will bloom—but only those who wait with patience shall see when.”
Defne planted the seed, watered it, turned their face to the sun—and waited.

Day One: Nothing.
Day Two: The soil cracked, but no sprout emerged.
Day Three: Other flowers bloomed, yet Defne’s seed remained silent.
A voice in Defne’s mind cried out:

“Maybe it was the wrong seed. Maybe I under‑watered it. Maybe the spot’s all wrong…”
Another voice whispered back:

“Patience isn’t just waiting—it’s waiting with hope.”
Resolute, Defne continued to water, continued to wait. And one morning… a tiny green sprout pushed through the earth.

The time‑keeper appeared:

“Time moves in its own rhythm. Your patience accompanied it. You have passed the first trial.”
Task Two: The Unanswered Reflection

Next, Defne stood at the edge of a still pond. Across the way floated a riddle, and only by gazing into the water could its answer appear.

They read:

“What walks without feet?”
Defne spoke up instantly:

“Time!”
But the pond remained motionless.

“A river?”
“The wind?”
The pond stayed silent. Frustration built as minutes ticked by. “I gave the answer—why won’t you accept it?” they fumed, rising to their feet.

At that moment, a leaf drifted onto the water. Ripples spread, and letters formed on the surface:

“A correct answer must also wait for its right moment.”
Defne sat again, took a deep breath—and waited. Finally, the water quivered and the word “Time” appeared.

The figure re‑emerged:

“Patience isn’t just knowing the answer—it’s waiting for the answer’s moment.”
Task Three: The Door That Doesn’t Call

For the final task, Defne walked a long path toward a golden door. Beside it, a sign read:

“This door opens only of its own will. Do not knock, do not push. Simply wait.”
Defne approached and raised a hand—but held back. They leaned against a nearby tree and waited.

Minutes—perhaps hours—passed. Whispered doubts arose:

“Give up. Find another door. This one won’t open.”
Yet deep within, Defne heard a truer voice:

“Patience is the willingness to wait without giving up.”
Suddenly, a sliver of light seeped through the door’s crack. It eased open.

The Hour of “Now”
Inside stood a table, and upon it sat a single clock. Its face bore only one word:

“Now”
In that instant, Defne understood: every moment has its own now. An answer given too soon or too late misses its time. Everything happens exactly when it’s meant to.

The figure appeared once more:

“Those who chase time never learn patience. You, who walk with time, now possess the Hour of Patience.”
They handed Defne a delicate pocket watch. Engraved on the back were words:

“Waiting is not wasted time—it is time’s gift.”
When Defne opened their eyes, they were back beneath the tree. The rain had stopped, and the sky was smiling.

The next day at school, instead of rushing to answer, Defne listened to classmates. In line at recess, they waited for others. While planting seedlings in the garden, they nurtured the soil with hopeful care rather than giving up because blooms didn’t appear instantly.

That afternoon, the teacher remarked gently:

“Something’s changed in you, Defne. There’s a quiet strength in your presence.”
Defne smiled:

“I’m learning to walk with time.”
From that day on, whenever impatience tugged, the pocket watch in their pocket would give a gentle shake—and echo in their mind:

“Patience is not slowness… it is waiting until the moment is right.”
And as Defne learned patience, time became not an adversary to outrun but a faithful companion along life’s path.
