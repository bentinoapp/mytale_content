Defne and the Sage Turtle

Once upon a time, in a place where the wind drifted softly, the trees whispered quietly, and every day overflowed with wonder, there lived a child named Defne. In the mornings, Defne listened to birdsong; at midday, Defne asked questions of the trees; in the evenings, Defne almost seemed to chat with the stars. Yet one feeling gnawed inside: impatience.

Whenever a problem appeared, Defne wanted an answer at once; whenever curiosity struck, Defne longed to know immediately. Even when trying to be patient, the thought “I must learn right now!” scurried through the child’s heart like a restless little squirrel.

One afternoon, after class, the teacher posed a riddle:

“It swims slowly, carries its house on its back, yet the heaviest load it bears is knowledge. Who is it?”

Defne’s hand shot up.
— “Turtle!”

The teacher nodded.
— “The answer is correct. But … sometimes knowing the answer is not enough; one must understand it. Wisdom is more than owning information. Think about that today.”

The words tangled in Defne’s mind. “So if I understand what I know, do I become wise?” the child murmured.

That evening, instead of heading straight home, Defne took a longer route. Feet wandered toward an old forest road almost no one used anymore. “Maybe while walking … I’ll figure out what they meant,” Defne thought.

The farther the path stretched, the quieter the forest grew. Branches knitted over the sky; sunlight thinned to a dim shimmer. At last Defne reached a small clearing where an old moss‑covered stone stood. On its surface glimmered a carving: a turtle shell.

At that moment a voice rose from the water nearby:
— “At last you have come, seeker …”

Eyes wide, Defne turned toward the sound. Beside a small pond sat an elderly, serene turtle. Its eyelids were half‑closed; its tone felt deep and reassuring.

— “Who are you?” asked Defne.
— “I am the Sage Turtle. I wait for those who search—and teach those who never stop,” replied the turtle.

Defne sat on the ground in amazement.
— “I want to know many things right away. My teacher asked the meaning of wisdom, but patience escapes me.”
— “Wisdom is no box that empties once opened,” said the Sage Turtle. “Those who travel the path understand—mere knowers do not.”

— “Then show me the path of wisdom,” Defne pleaded.

The turtle nodded.
— “Be ready. First wisdom slows you, then it deepens you, then it keeps you walking with questions.”

The turtle ambled to the water’s edge. Three stones lay there, each engraved with a word:

SEE – LISTEN – THINK

The First Task — SEE
— “Your first task is SEE. Not only with your eyes—see with your heart. Find the clue along the trail.”

Defne walked beneath the trees. Stones, flowers, birds—things seen on many days—now drew sharper focus. A squirrel peeked from a hollow, a butterfly danced above a blossom, an ant traced a trail in the soil. Finally Defne spotted a symbol carved into an old trunk: a question mark.

— “What is this?”

The Sage Turtle appeared.
— “You saw well. Wisdom begins with not fearing questions. You have learned to see.”

The Second Task — LISTEN
Next came LISTEN. The turtle led Defne to a riverbank.
— “You will meet three speakers here. Only one tells the truth. Ask no questions—simply listen.”

The first speaker declared,
— “I am always right, for I speak the loudest.”

The second insisted,
— “Being right is not important; being powerful is. With power, my words are truth.”

The third said softly,
— “I may not prove what I say, yet I weigh my words within before I speak.”

After a silent pause Defne bowed to the third speaker.
— “Your words reach my heart; you carry them inside. The others merely made noise.”

The turtle stepped out from behind a tree.
— “You have listened. Wisdom is noticing feeling more than sound.”

The Third Task — THINK
For THINK, the turtle guided Defne to a meadow where two paths opened. One was short and straight; the other long and stony.
— “Either will lead you out, yet only one will add wisdom.”

Defne studied the short route, then the long one with its rocks and thorns. The short way held no life. Along the long path sang birds, bloomed flowers, even a small bridge arched over a stream.

“The harder road is the one that teaches,” Defne decided, stepping onto the longer track. Stones bruised feet, thorns tore a sleeve, yet at last Defne reached a clearing full of flowers. The Sage Turtle was waiting.

— “Now you are ready,” said the turtle.
— “Have I learned wisdom?”
— “No. Yet you have learned to ask, tried to listen, chose by thinking. Wisdom is the sum of those steps.”

The turtle turned toward the pond.
— “It is time to go. Remember: to be wise is not to know everything. At times it means pausing, sometimes listening, sometimes admitting a mistake.”

Home with Three Stones
When Defne blinked, the forest had vanished; the child sat in the schoolyard holding three stones marked

SEE – LISTEN – THINK

The teacher approached.
— “I asked you a riddle yesterday. Have you an answer today?”

Defne smiled gently.
— “Turtle … but knowing the answer is not enough. One must live like the turtle.”

The teacher returned the smile.
— “Such words are where wisdom begins.”

Above, clouds shifted shapes, and Defne saw one that looked just like a turtle. Deep inside, a thought arose:

“To be wise is to grow slowly—just like a turtle …”
