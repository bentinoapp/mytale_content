Three Questions in the Land of Mirrors

One morning [HERO] looked into the mirror right after waking up—and saw not their own reflection. Staring back was someone who looked exactly like [HERO] but with eyes of a different color. That reflection suddenly winked.

Before [HERO] could react, a voice rose from the glass:

“Good morning, [HERO]. You made a choice today—you chose to see the unknown instead of the familiar. Therefore, we invite you to the Land of Mirrors.”

The figure in the mirror traced a circle on the glass, and a doorway appeared. The surface rippled like water rather than glass.

[HERO] took a long breath and stepped through.

Arrival in the Mirror Land
When [HERO] opened their eyes, they stood in a luminous valley where everything seemed reversed: tree leaves pointed toward the ground while the roots reached for the sky; birds were silent, yet stones were singing.

At the start of the path a golden sign read:

“In this world everything works by questions.
You may ask only three questions.
Find the answers and you will find your way;
fail, and you will wander here forever.”

Only three questions? Timing would matter.

The road split in two: one trail twisted upward, the other sank into a forest. Just as [HERO] hesitated, a whisper floated by:

“Your first choice shapes your first question…”

Riddle 1: Which Door Is True?
[HERO] chose the forest path and soon reached two doors. One bore the words True Path, the other False Path. Both looked equally splendid. In front of them stood two guards, one in blue, one in red.

The Blue Guard said, “I always speak the truth.”

The Red Guard added, “I sometimes lie and sometimes tell the truth.”

A voice from within announced:

“It is time for your first question.
Which door hides the true path?”

Asking either guard directly seemed risky, but [HERO] recalled an old logic puzzle. Turning to the Red Guard, [HERO] asked:

“If I were to ask the Blue Guard which door I should take, which door would they point to?”

The Red Guard replied, “The door on the right.”

At once [HERO] chose the door on the left. Whether the Red Guard had lied or told the truth, the answer had to be reversed—perfect for a world of mirrors.

Soft light flared as [HERO] passed through: the first test was clear.

Riddle 2: The Weight You Can’t See
In the next clearing stood a large balance scale. Smooth white stones filled both pans, yet one side hung low, the other high.

A voice echoed:

“Here, weight is measured by knowledge.
Why is one side heavier?
Will this be your second question?”

[HERO] paused. Before asking, they examined the stones. Under the light only some cast shadows; others let light pass through.

They thought, They look the same, yet their insides differ—some are filled with knowledge, some with emptiness.

Aloud [HERO] said:

“The scale weighs the unseen. Stones full of knowledge are heavier.”

They did not spend a question.

Instantly the balance leveled. The answer was correct—two tests passed with only one question used.

Riddle 3: Speak to the Mirror
At the center of the Land of Mirrors stood a colossal talking mirror.

“I am not your reflection—I am your inner voice.
You may ask me only one question.
Ask the right one and I will show the exit;
ask the wrong one and you will remain.”

In the glass [HERO] saw not a single reflection but versions of themself at every age—child, youth, elder.

The mirror repeated, “What is your question, [HERO]?”

Dozens of questions raced through [HERO]’s mind:

“Where is the exit?”

“Which path is correct?”

“When can I return?”

None felt right. In this realm, meaning lay in the quality of the question, not the answer.

Finally [HERO] drew a deep breath and asked:

“Who do I want to become?”

The mirror was silent. Then, in its center, golden words appeared:

“One who asks this question is already on the right path.”

Light burst outward; the mirror melted away, leaving a radiant doorway. Above it glowed the words:

“Who seeks themself will find themself.”

Having used the third and final question, [HERO] stepped through.

Outside the Mirror
In an instant [HERO] was back in the bedroom. But the eyes in the mirror now held a new brightness. [HERO] felt deeper, more complete—aware not only of their appearance but of their inner voice.

Across the glass, shining letters read:

“Every child is a mirror.
When you begin to understand yourself, the world grows clearer.”

And Ever After…
From that day on [HERO] learned that asking the right question can matter more than finding the fastest answer. Whenever confusion arose, they paused before choosing a direction and wondered:

“What will the answer to this question truly give me?”

Thus, although [HERO] left the Land of Mirrors behind, that realm lived on—every morning, whenever [HERO] looked into the mirror and listened inside.
