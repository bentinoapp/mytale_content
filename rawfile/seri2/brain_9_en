The Child Who Draws Time

Chapter 1 – The Pen That Broke the Clock
[HERO] was sketching a clock in their notebook, as always setting the hands at “12:00.”
But this time something felt odd.

The magic pen made the drawn hand gleam, as if light streamed from the lines.
Suddenly the classroom fell silent. The chalkboard, the wall clock—even the daylight outside—seemed frozen.

Startled, [HERO] stared at the pen. Almost erased on its barrel was an inscription:

“Time flows only as far as your line.”

In an instant, the clock drawing in the notebook swirled to life, grew larger, spilled off the page…and pulled [HERO] inside.

Chapter 2 – The Realm of Stopped Time
When [HERO] opened their eyes, they found themselves in a motionless world.
Leaves hung stuck on branches, the wind had ceased, birds paused in midair.
Everything… was at a standstill.

A child appeared beside them, sketched in shades of gray but with bright, living eyes.

“I’m Dakiko, one of the Time‑Drawers,” the child said.
“The Wheel of Time has broken because people believed time merely passes.
But time is lived—it’s never forgotten.
Now you must draw three times:
Past, Present, and Future,
and fill them with true meaning.
Only then will the world flow again.”

[HERO] nodded. The magic pen in their hand glowed.

Chapter 3 – Drawing the Past
Dakiko led [HERO] to a blank canvas carved onto a stone plinth. As the pen shimmered, words appeared:

“The Past isn’t what’s forgotten, but what stays alive when remembered.
Draw now: the memory that has brought you the greatest joy.”

With closed eyes, [HERO] recalled a holiday memory by the sea:
bare feet on warm sand, the crash of waves, their parents’ laughter, the bird‑shaped ice cream cone pressed into their hand.

The pen moved on its own. Soft blues and whites, smiles and sunshine appeared on the canvas. At its corner, time flowed again: birds took flight, leaves drifted down. The Past had come alive.

“Whoever lives the Past restarts Time,” Dakiko said.

Chapter 4 – Drawing the Present
The next canvas was like a mirror—but there was no reflection, only a waiting emptiness.

“The Present is everything you think but haven’t done.
An unacted thought leaves time hollow.
Draw now: something you want to do today but have postponed.”

[HERO] hesitated.
They pictured many things:
apologizing to a friend, finishing a half‑written story, pausing to simply watch the sky.

The pen trembled, first in gray, then bold with color. It sketched an unfinished letter, a book open halfway, and a wide window view: someone gazing toward the horizon.

A breeze stirred across the canvas, flowers swayed—and time advanced.

“Whoever recognizes the Present guides Time,” Dakiko said.

Chapter 5 – Drawing the Future
The final canvas was like aged parchment, its hue golden and shifting as lines appeared.

“The Future is not a dream but the current you shape.
Draw now: a moment you wish to create responsibly.”

[HERO] thought: What do I truly desire?
They envisioned themselves presenting their invention at a science fair—the crowd’s surprised faces, the question, “Is this yours?”—and there they stood, smiling with confidence.

The pen began hesitantly, then with growing courage outlined the scene: a stage, a gleaming project, beams of light.

The parchment glowed. The Future’s lines unfurled like a path, footprints appearing along it.

“Not the one who dreams of the Future, but the one who draws it, truly lives,” Dakiko said.

Chapter 6 – The Rebirth of Time
When the three canvases were complete, the sky above shifted in color. Leaves fluttered down, birds beat their wings, and a breeze returned.

Dakiko stepped close to [HERO].

“You have not just lived time—you thought it, noticed it, and drew it.
Now you are a Time‑Drawer yourself.
But the greatest drawing is the one you will create all your life.
Remember:
The Past teaches,
the Present is lived,
the Future is guided.”

A clock image appeared—but instead of numbers, its face bore three words:

Remember – Act – Shape

[HERO] closed their eyes.

Chapter 7 – The Pen’s Tip Still Shines
When [HERO] opened their eyes again, they were back in the classroom—but now the chalkboard clock was running. The bell rang, and classmates stirred.

Looking at their notebook, [HERO] saw the drawn clock’s hands turning once more. But there was a difference: at each hand’s tip were tiny words:

Past: Joy
Present: Courage
Future: Light

And the magic pen in [HERO]’s hand still glowed faintly.

And Thus the Tale Ends…
From that day forward, [HERO] measured time not by a ticking clock but by the moments they lived, learned, and shaped. And they carried this truth always:

“Time is not something that merely passes—it is a story drawn, formed, and made alive.”
