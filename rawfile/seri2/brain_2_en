The Cloud Factory’s Password

[HERO] woke up that morning and looked at the sky. The blue that should have stretched overhead was completely empty—no white cotton‑wool clouds, no birds darting about. It felt as if the sky itself had been forgotten.

Staring out the window, [HERO] noticed something odd: a thin mist drifted from the top of the huge oak at the far end of the garden, like the trace of a dream that had slipped away.

In a flash, [HERO] kicked on slippers and dashed outside. At the base of the tree lay a letter, pinned to the trunk. It read:

“The sky is silent because the clouds are lost.
Only someone who can use imagination can bring them back.
If you wish to rescue the clouds, we await you at the Cloud Factory.
But remember: you must solve the password to enter.
— Silver Sky Council”

A password? A Cloud Factory? Too exciting to be real! [HERO]’s eyes sparkled.

Just then the roots of the oak shuddered. They parted to reveal a hidden lift. Its doors, white as cloud, slid open without a sound.

[HERO] took a deep breath and stepped inside.

1 st Floor — Imagination Tunnel
Instead of descending, the lift glided upward, yet every floor felt weightless, as though gravity had taken a holiday. The first stop was the Imagination Tunnel.

When the doors opened, a wide corridor burst into view. Animals swooped through the air, flowers pirouetted across moving walls, and children’s drawings of clouds drifted along the ceiling. A riddle blocked the entrance:

“Are clouds always white?
In an inventor’s eye, their colors take flight.
Tell me now:
When can a cloud turn red?”

Choices:

A) At sunrise
B) During a rainstorm
C) Just before sleep
D) Only in a dream

Scanning the murals, [HERO] spotted a picture of a child asleep beneath a red cloud.

“D—Only in a dream,” [HERO] answered.

Instantly the walls flared into a rainbow and a new passage opened.

2 nd Floor — The Sound Room
Here everything was utterly silent—so silent that [HERO] couldn’t even hear their own breathing. In the center stood a microphone with a note:

“Clouds grow by listening to sound.
Stay quiet and they fade.
Create a noise born of imagination.”

[HERO] hesitated, then closed their eyes. Stretching out both arms, they breathed a long “whoooosh”, followed by a birdlike “chirrr chirrr.”

The air shivered; a tiny puff of cloud bubbled from the mic and floated to the ceiling. Words appeared on the walls:

“Real clouds are made not by sky, but by imagination.”

[HERO] grinned. So that’s why it was so quiet…

3 rd Floor — Shape Room
This level felt like another universe. Mirror‑like walls reflected not reality but fantastical designs: an elephant‑shaped cloud here, a heart‑shaped one there.

In the center stood three cloud figures—yet one didn’t belong.

“One shape is out of place,
For it was never born of dream.
Which is the excess?”

A) Flying fish
B) Smiling tree
C) Four‑sided cloud
D) Mountain shaped like a rabbit

[HERO] examined the mirrors. A square cloud never appears in nature; the rest, strange as they were, still suited imagination.

“C—The four‑sided cloud.”

The other three figures merged and drifted upward, forming a fresh cloud on the ceiling. A single letter shimmered upon it:

S

4 th Floor — Memory Level
This floor differed from the rest. Four square panels glowed on the wall, each showing a brief scene:

A child picking daisies.

The same child reading a book.

Swinging on a playground swing.

Gazing at the sky, whispering, “You became my dream…”

Puzzle: “Which happened first?”

[HERO] pondered. Swinging is fun, but picking daisies often starts an adventure. Reading usually comes later, and the whispered line requires imagination already in motion.

“A feeling begins before words,” [HERO] said. “So the first moment must be the daisy‑picking.”

“1—Picking daisies.”

All four panels flared with light and another letter appeared:

A

5 th Floor — Code Level: The Password
At the top, a sealed door blocked the way. A large digital screen displayed:

“To form the password, combine:
• The first letter shaped by imagination
• The second letter of the sound you created in silence
• The letter of the excess shape
• The second letter of the memory answer”

[HERO] reviewed the clues:

First letter of imagination → the cloud letter S

Silent‑room sound “chirrr” → second letter C

Excess shape → D (square cloud)

Memory answer “Daisy” → second letter A

Password: S C D A

The door vibrated, lights spun, and with a massive click it swung open.

The Heart of the Cloud Factory
Inside lay a hall vaster than any [HERO] had ever seen. Giant pipes rose like arms into the sky, and soft white vapor filled the space. At the center, an enormous machine pulsed like a living heart.

A silver‑hued robot rolled up, tiny cap perched atop its head, eyes glowing.

“Congratulations, [HERO]. Only true dreamers solve the password. With you, the clouds will be reborn.”

[HERO] looked skyward. Small white wisps were already forming—first circles, then elephants, then hearts—each one born of imagination.

The robot continued:

“From now on, the clouds will feed on your dreams. Whatever you imagine at night will shape the sky by morning.”

And After the Tale…
When [HERO] returned home, the sky was alive again. On the way to school, they spotted a cloud shaped like a bicycle. Another night, [HERO] dreamed of stars; at dawn, star‑shaped clouds glimmered overhead.

Ever since, whenever anyone looked up and marveled at a strange cloud, [HERO] would whisper inside:

“That was my dream…”
