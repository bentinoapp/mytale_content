The Crow and the Hourglass

Time flows swiftly on some days and drags on others.
But that morning [HERO] realized that time was moving both forward and backward: the bedside clock said 7:30, yet the sun was already high in the sky.

The bread on the breakfast table was still warm, but the milk had spoiled. Something was wrong—time was not behaving as it should.

Just then a black feather drifted through the window, followed by a shrill voice:

“Tick‑tock, the clock is lost—time has slipped.
Welcome to Time‑Sand Isle, [HERO].
My name is Mr. Kraa, the Time Crow.”

Perched on the sill, the coal‑feathered crow with a grey beak looked [HERO] up and down.

“If you don’t help, time will shatter.
Everyone will be born and grow old in a single day—some will never wake at all.”

[HERO] rose in uncertainty. “How can we set time right?”

Mr. Kraa held out a small hourglass in his beak.

“The sand within belongs to Time‑Sand Isle,
but the balance is broken.
You must visit four Time Points, each testing a skill: Patience, Planning, Observation, and Understanding.
If you’re ready, let’s fly.”

In an instant [HERO] found themself lifting into the sky on the crow’s back.

Stop 1: Patience Peak
The first stop was Patience Peak, where soft winds blew and everything was calm and slow. In the center stood a great stone ring. In its middle rested a single flower bud with a note:

“This flower opens only for those who wait.
The impatient will never see it.
Wait, watch, stay still.
You may touch it once—feel the right moment.”

[HERO] sat by the bud. Mr. Kraa stayed silent. Minutes passed.
The sun climbed.
The bud quivered, yet [HERO] kept still.
A bird called.
The bud swelled farther.
A breeze stirred.

At that exact moment the bud burst open, scattering colored petals into the air. A golden grain of sand rose from its heart.

Mr. Kraa nodded. “Patience is the first key of time.”

The grain slipped into the hourglass; time began to tick again.

Stop 2: Planning Compass
Next they reached the Planning Compass—an enormous valley of rock with a map on the ground and five branching paths.

Inscription:

“Only one path moves you forward.
The rest return you to the start.
Each path lasts fifteen minutes.
You have just two chances.
Solve the clue, choose a way.”

On the clue‑stone:

“The sun always rises in the east,
but every shadow falls to the west.
Time walks with the shadow.”

[HERO] saw their shadow to the right; therefore the sun was at the left—east on the left, west on the right.

The map showed five roads: North, South, East, West, and Center.
[HERO] planted a stick in the ground and watched the shadow stretch furthest west. “Time walks with the shadow,” so west it must be.

Choosing the western path, [HERO] arrived twenty minutes later at a ridge where another golden grain of sand awaited.

“Planning gives direction to patience,” said Mr. Kraa.

The hourglass filled a step further.

Stop 3: Observation Lake
The lake lay still as a mirror. On its shore rested four chests, each marked with a symbol: Star, Leaf, Wave, Moon. One reflected image in the water differed.

Inscription:

“Only the shape mirrored on the lake reveals truth.
Others deceive the eye.
Which chest does not match its reflection?”

[HERO] examined the images:

Star chest: five points—same in water.

Leaf chest: three tips—same in water.

Wave chest: curved top—yet the reflection showed a straight line.

Moon chest: crescent—yet the reflection was a full circle.

The wave’s straight reflection was natural on a flat surface, but a crescent turning full was impossible; the Moon chest was the false one.

“Moon,” [HERO] declared.

The chest opened, releasing a gleaming grain of sand. Mr. Kraa clicked his beak.

“Observation is the mirror of time.”

Stop 4: Field of Understanding
The final stop was a floating stone island among the clouds, bearing a colossal slab engraved with a riddle:

“A child wakes at dawn,
sketches before breakfast,
drinks milk afterward,
then paints the chair seen in a dream.
Tell me—what does the child long for?”

[HERO] read again: a dream chair… drawing, painting, a chair…

Tears welled up.
A chair… an empty place… longing…

Softly at first, then aloud:

“Someone to sit there—someone the child misses… perhaps a grandmother.”

The slab glowed, and a final grain of sand sprang forth.

“Understanding is the heart of time,” said Mr. Kraa.
“Time is measured not only by minutes, but by feelings.”

Time Flows Again
The hourglass was now complete. The sand slipped downward in steady rhythm. Time was mended.

Mr. Kraa turned to [HERO]:

“To repair time you needed patience, planning, observation, and understanding.
You carry them all.”

Suddenly [HERO] awoke in bed. The clock still showed 7:30, yet everything was as it should be: the sun was just rising, the milk was fresh, and the bread—still warm.

After the Tale…
From that day on, [HERO] measured time not only by a clock, but by actions. While helping someone, time vanished; while seeking to understand, time was gained. And now and then Mr. Kraa’s voice echoed inside:

“To guide time, look not at the clock, but at your own heart.”
