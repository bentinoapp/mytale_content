Defne Somersaults on Uranus

Defne Somersaults on Uranus
Defne walked into the garden after school one day and lay on the ground. The sky was dazzlingly clear—no clouds drifted, and birds sang. Yet a much more distant place occupied Defne’s thoughts.
“Uranus,” Defne murmured. “One of the ice giants. But why is the axis always tilted? Why does it seem to roll instead of spin?”

While pondering this, Defne pulled out a small notebook. The teacher had remarked in class:

“Uranus’s axis tilts at exactly 98 degrees. That means it spins almost sideways—like performing a somersault around the Sun.”

A look of astonishment crossed Defne’s face.
“Why does this planet somersault while all the others simply spin as they orbit?”
Later that night, gazing at the stars, Defne whispered out of habit:
“I want to go to Uranus. I need to learn why the axis tilts.”

Backwards‑Spiraling Space Snail
The ceiling crackled once more. This time, the approaching spacecraft moved in an unusual way: spinning on its own axis again and again, it advanced like a snail. Its hull was painted in blue‑green hues, and along the side read:

“Uranus Mission: Journey on a Tilted Axis”

Defne fastened a special backpack designed to maintain balance during spinning.
“If Uranus spins, then spinning alongside makes sense,” Defne said with a laugh.

The space snail glided among the stars. Saturn faded into the distance; the Sun shrank to a tiny point of light. Ahead, a blue‑green orb glittered like a distant jewel.
A computer voice announced:

“Destination: Uranus. Ice giant. Seventh planet in the Solar System. Axis tilt: 98 degrees.”

A Sideways Planet
Upon approach, Defne gazed in amazement. Uranus spun around the Sun like a ball rolling on its side.
“Truly like a somersault... but why?”

The computer explained:

“Exact cause unknown. Impact from a large celestial body may have knocked it into this tilt.”

Defne pondered:
“So one collision toppled the planet... yet it continued to spin.”

Eyes wide with wonder, Defne exclaimed:
“This planet is like someone who, even after a fall, tries to stand tall!”

Calm but Cold
As the ship neared Uranus, Defne peered out the window. The atmosphere appeared flat, silent, and shrouded in mist.
“Such a serene planet,” came the observation.
The computer replied:

“Uranus is the coldest planet in the Solar System. Temperatures can drop to –224 °C.”

Defne registered surprise:
“But Neptune is farther away, so why is Uranus colder?”

“The planet struggles to release internal heat. Therefore, it retains very little incoming warmth.”

Looking out the window, Defne shivered.
“The loneliness of this world feels as cold as ice…”

Surface or Depth?
The vessel descended just below the atmosphere. No solid surface appeared—Uranus has none!
The computer explained:

“Uranus lacks a distinct solid surface. The upper layers consist of hydrogen, helium, and methane gases. Below lies a mixture of liquid ices and rock.”

Defne asked in wonder:
“So no ground to stand on?”

“No. But any descent leads deeper into denser layers.”

This notion both frightened and fascinated Defne.
“Like a dream filled with liquid…”

The Secret of the Blue
Defne noticed the color outside. Uranus possessed a shade of blue found on no other planet.
“This blue… why so unique?”
The computer clarified:

“Methane in the atmosphere absorbs red light and reflects blue light. That is why Uranus appears in this hue.”

A smile crossed Defne’s face:
“So the blue comes from methane. Even the color is not a choice, but a characteristic.”

Uranus’s Rings and Moons
The rings of Uranus were not as broad and bright as Saturn’s but appeared as faint lines glowing in the dark.
The computer provided details:

“Uranus has 13 rings. Most are dark and thin.”

Defne registered surprise:
“So even this planet wears rings, yet they are simple and hidden…”

The computer continued:

“Uranus has 27 moons. The largest is Titania. Moon names derive from characters in Shakespeare’s plays.”

Wide-eyed, Defne asked:
“Do planets have any connection to literature?”
The computer replied with a laugh:

“Perhaps Uranus adopted a slightly artistic flair.”

Time to Return
The ship slowly changed course. Defne turned to gaze at the planet once more.
“Calm and cold you remain, yet despite the tilt you keep spinning.”

Suddenly, a faint voice emerged from Uranus itself:

“Slowness does not hinder strength. A tilt is not surrender. I simply orbit in my own way.”

That phrase glowed like a star within Defne’s heart:
“I can do this too—chart my own path in rotation...”

From Defne’s Notebook: The Mystery of Uranus
URANUS: The Silent Planet on a Tilted Axis
– Seventh planet in the Solar System.
– Axis tilted at 98 degrees, thus it rotates almost horizontally.
– An ice giant with no solid surface.
– Atmosphere contains methane gas, hence the blue appearance.
– Coldest planet, with temperatures reaching –224 °C.
– Possesses 13 rings and 27 moons.
– Moon names derive from characters in Shakespeare’s works.

Lying in bed that night, Defne smiled:
“One day I might fall... but like Uranus, I will continue to spin on my own axis.”
