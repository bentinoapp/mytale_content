Defne and the Mystery of the Galaxy

Defne knew every planet by now—Mercury’s heat, Venus’s dance, Mars’s dust, Jupiter’s storms, Saturn’s rings, Uranus’s somersault, Neptune’s winds, even the Sun’s heart. But one night while gazing at the sky, Defne noticed something new:

“All these planets, stars, moons… but where are they all, exactly?”

That day in class, the teacher had spoken of the Milky Way Galaxy:

“The Milky Way is our galaxy. It contains hundreds of billions of stars, planets, and systems. Our Solar System is just a tiny corner of it.”

Those words opened a huge door in Defne’s mind.

“So we live inside one system… and that system lives inside something even bigger…”

Lying in bed that night, Defne whispered a final wish:

“I want to visit our galaxy. I want to see the secrets of the Milky Way.”

A Staircase Made of Light
This time the ceiling didn’t form a pathway but a staircase of light reaching upward. Each step glittered with star‑dust. At the top awaited a spiraling starship, and on its hull were the words:

“Galaxy Mission: Journey to the Heart of the Milky Way”

Defne donned a spacesuit patterned with star maps and a tiny galaxy emblem on the chest.

“Today I’m not just going somewhere—I’m going everywhere,” Defne said with a smile.

Leaving Earth Behind
As the ship climbed, Defne watched the Solar System shrink—first the planets, then the whole system reduced to a speck.

“Everything is like a grain of dust… How small we really are.”

The computer announced:

“Target: Milky Way Galaxy. Diameter approximately 100,000 light‑years. Estimated 200–400 billion stars.”

Defne bit the lip.

“Billions? We orbit just one of them!”
“Yes,” the computer replied. “The Sun is an ordinary star—but very special to us.”

Among the Spiral Arms
Soon the vessel entered a colossal spiral structure: arms of stars sweeping around like rivers of light. Defne couldn’t look away.

“This can’t be real. It’s like a dream woven from stars.”

The computer explained:

“The Milky Way is a spiral galaxy with four main arms. Our Solar System lies in the Orion Arm, on a quiet edge.”

Defne drew in a breath.

“So we’re not at the center, but off to the side?”
“Correct,” said the computer. “Yet every star has its place and purpose.”

The Galaxy’s Heart: A Supermassive Black Hole
As the ship headed toward the center, a vast dark region appeared. Stars seemed to vanish as they neared it.

“What is that?” Defne asked.

The computer spoke in a serious tone:

“This is the core of the Milky Way. At its heart lies a supermassive black hole: Sagittarius A*.”

Defne narrowed the eyes.

“A black hole… something that pulls everything in?”
“Yes. Even light cannot escape. Yet its gravity holds the galaxy together.”

Defne swallowed.

“Terrifying, yet unifying…”
“Sometimes darkness brings order,” said the computer.

We Are Not Alone
Looking out, Defne spotted other galaxies in the distance—spiral, elliptical, irregular… some bright with young stars, others faint, each a universe in itself.

“Are those galaxies too?”
“Yes,” said the computer. “The universe may contain around two trillion galaxies.”

Defne shook the head in wonder.

“I can’t even imagine. We’re in a galaxy of billions of stars, and it’s just one among billions…”
“The universe is vast,” the computer said with a smile, “but not as vast as your curiosity.”

Speaking with the Galaxy
Suddenly space itself seemed to hum. From the spiral arms came a warm voice:

“I am the Milky Way. I have watched you, little traveler. Your questions keep me alive.”

Defne bowed the head.

“I only sought to understand… where we are, why we’re here…”
“You are a light,” said the Milky Way. “Every light begins with a question. Your journey is its own meaning.”

Ready to Return?
The computer warned:

“Initiating return to Earth.”

Defne took one last look at the spiral arms, star clusters, and glowing nebulae as they drifted away.

“Each one is a story, a world of its own…”

The Milky Way spoke one final time:

“Do not forget me. I hold the answers to all your questions—yet every answer opens a new question.”

From Defne’s Notebook: The Mystery of the Galaxy
THE MILKY WAY GALAXY
– The galaxy that contains our Solar System
– Roughly 100,000 light‑years across
– A spiral shape with four main arms
– Our Sun sits in the Orion Arm at the galaxy’s edge
– Sagittarius A*—a supermassive black hole—lies at its center
– Contains 200–400 billion stars
– The universe holds billions of other galaxies

Defne sat up in bed and looked out the window at the night sky—not just at the stars, but at the space between them, knowing there was meaning there too.

“I am a tiny part of the universe… yet my questions shine brighter than all the stars.”
