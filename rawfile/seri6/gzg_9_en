Defne’s Journey to the Sun

One sunny morning, Defne sat at the kitchen table sipping orange juice. Sunlight streamed through the window like an invitation. Defne’s mother drew back the curtain.

“Isn’t that a lovely light?” she said.

Defne nodded but stared off into the distance.

Earlier that day in class, the teacher had explained:

“The Sun is the closest star to Earth. It provides light, heat, and life. But it is so hot and massive that approaching it is almost impossible.”

Defne’s eyes had gone wide.

“A star?” Defne had asked.
The teacher smiled.
“Yes. The Sun is a star—just the one nearest to us.”

From that moment on, Defne’s curiosity burned:

“What is the Sun really like? Could I ever look inside?”

That night, tucked in bed with eyes closed, Defne whispered to the stars:

“I want to go to the Sun. I want to see the heart of the greatest light.”

The Light‑Winged Ship
This time the ceiling glowed with golden light. Warmth rippled through the room—comforting, not scorching. A vessel shimmered into view, covered in golden scales that danced with the light. On its hull were the words:

“Sun Mission: Voyage to the Heart of Light”

Defne donned a special suit, this one coated in reflective silver mesh.

“Nothing could match this sparkle,” Defne smiled.

Squint as You Approach
The ship accelerated. Earth shrank below, the Moon receded, planets turned into distant points. Ahead grew a gigantic sphere ablaze with light: the SUN.

The ship slowed, for extreme caution was required. The computer announced:

“Target: Sun. Diameter 109 times Earth’s. Surface temperature 5,500 °C. Core temperature 15 million °C.”

Defne squinted.

“How can we get close to something so hot?”

The computer replied:

“Only with exceptionally strong heat shields. Landing is impossible—no solid surface exists. The Sun is entirely gas and plasma.”

Journey Through the Layers
The ship drifted into the Sun’s outer layer: the corona. Defne pressed the face to the window. Flames, sparks, and immense waves of plasma twisted and turned.

“It… almost feels alive!”

The computer explained:

“The Sun has three main zones: the core, the radiative zone, and the convective zone. Beyond those lies the atmosphere: photosphere, chromosphere, and corona.”

Defne’s mouth fell open.

“So those eruptions come from the outer atmosphere?”
“Yes. The outer atmosphere is hotter than layers beneath—a mystery still under study.”

Speaking with a Flame’s Voice
As the ship neared a flame tongue, a deep, humming voice rang out:

“I am the Sun. I give birth to life—but everything has its price.”

Defne did not shrink back. Instead, the heart warmed.

“You heat us, grow the plants, separate night from day.”

The Sun answered gently:

“True. I generate energy in my core by fusing hydrogen into helium. That process is nuclear fusion.”

Defne nodded.

“So you produce energy continuously and send it out as light!”
“Yes. Every second I release millions of tons of energy. That light reaches Earth in eight minutes.”

Sunspots and Solar Storms
The ship descended slightly, revealing dark patches on the surface.

“What are those spots?”

The computer responded:

“Sunspots. They are regions of concentrated magnetic fields with lower temperatures.”

Defne studied them.

“They look like wrinkles on a brow—tired spots?”
“No,” said the computer. “They store energy. Sometimes they erupt in solar flares.”

At that moment, a colossal flare burst out, sending light and plasma into space.

“Is that… a solar storm?” Defne asked.
“Yes. Known as a coronal mass ejection. When aimed at Earth, it can create auroras—but may also disrupt technology.”

You Cannot Stare Unprotected
Defne had to narrow the eyes even inside the ship.

“That glow is too bright. It would blind me from afar.”
“That is why special glasses are used on Earth,” said the computer. “The unprotected eye cannot endure such brilliance.”

Defne drew in a breath.

“You are so powerful, yet so gentle. Too close you burn, but from afar you give life.”

The Sun replied softly:

“My light demands balance. Too much burns; too little freezes.”

And What of Tomorrow?
Defne asked one last question:

“Will you always stay the same?”

The Sun answered:

“No. I am in my youth now. But in billions of years, my fuel will run low. I will swell into a red giant, then shrink into a white dwarf.”

Defne felt a pang.

“So one day you will exist without us… and without you, we cannot exist.”
“Such is nature’s cycle,” the Sun said.
“Every light fades, but new lights are born.”

Time to Return
The computer announced:

“Initiating return to Earth.”

Defne pressed the face to the window one last time.

“Thank you, Sun. You grow me, warm me, you are life.”
“And I will continue to shine because of your curiosity,” the Sun replied.
“Live in my light, never forgetting it.”

From Defne’s Notebook: The Sun’s Heart
THE SUN: Our Nearest Star
– Diameter: 109× Earth’s. Mass: 330,000× Earth’s.
– Produces energy by fusing hydrogen into helium (nuclear fusion).
– Surface temperature: 5,500 °C. Core temperature: 15 million °C.
– Atmosphere: Photosphere, Chromosphere, Corona.
– Sunspots mark intense magnetic fields.
– Solar flares and coronal mass ejections can produce Earth’s auroras.
– Sunlight takes eight minutes to reach Earth.
– In billions of years, will become a red giant, then a white dwarf.

Defne sat up in bed. Dawn had not yet come, but the warmth of light glowed within.

“I am a spark of light too. I will share it, multiply it, just like the Sun…”
