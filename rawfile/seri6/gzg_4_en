Defne’s Footprints on Mars

That morning, while Defne was eating breakfast, their father pointed to a headline in the newspaper:

“NASA’s Mars rover has collected fresh rock samples!”

Defne’s eyes lit up. “So robots really are roaming Mars? What about people—will humans ever get there?”

Their father smiled. “Not just yet, but plans are underway. The first person to set foot on Mars might be someone your age—who knows?”

That idea sparkled in Defne’s mind like a distant star. “Why not me? Why couldn’t I be the first to walk on Mars?”

After school, Defne ran straight to their room, sat at the window, closed their eyes and whispered:

“I want to walk on Mars. I want to see if life could really exist there.”

The Gateway to Space
The ceiling glowed again. This time a swirl of crimson dust formed in the center of the room, then coalesced into a massive vehicle. On its side were the words:

“Mars Mission: First Steps on the Red Planet”

Defne donned a custom Mars suit—deep red and dust‑proof—complete with a helmet‑mounted camera.
“Get ready, Mars—I’m coming!” they said with a grin.

As the craft slipped into Mars orbit, the computer voice announced:

“Target: Mars, the fourth planet from the Sun. Its red hue comes from iron oxide—rust—on its surface.”

Peering out, Defne saw a world painted in shades between orange and rust. The ground looked cracked and dusty—alien, yet mesmerizing.

Touching Red Sands
The lander descended onto a vast plateau. A small display lit up:

“Landing Zone: Jezero Crater”

When the hatch opened, Defne stepped onto windswept slopes of cracked soil and scattered rocks.
“It feels like nobody’s ever been here,” they murmured.

Suddenly, a four‑wheeled, metallic‑grey robot with extendable arms rolled into view.

“Hello! I’m Curio, Mars’s research rover,” it beeped.

Defne clapped with excitement.
“You’re the robot from the newspaper!”

Curio dipped its mast.
“My mission is to analyze rocks, soil, and air particles—searching for any trace that life once existed here.”

Rivers of a Bygone Age
Curio guided Defne to the edge of a broad valley.
“This used to be a riverbed. You can still see the channels carved by flowing water.”

Defne gazed at the gently curved rocks and smooth stones.
“So Mars really had water once…”

“Billions of years ago,” Curio confirmed.
“There were lakes and rivers. But over time the atmosphere thinned and the water vapor boiled away.”

Defne sighed.
“If water was here, maybe life was too?”

“Possibly,” Curio replied. “That’s why every sample matters—I won’t miss a single clue.”

Dust Storms and Tiny Footprints
As they walked, a haze of fine dust began to swirl.
“Dust storm approaching—seal your helmet!” Curio warned.

Defne checked their suit as visibility dropped.
“Mars’s air really isn’t welcoming.”

“Indeed,” Curio said.

“The atmosphere is 96% carbon dioxide—unbreathable. Dust storms can blanket the entire planet.”

When the storm eased, Defne noticed their footprints in the red dust.
“These might be the first child’s footprints on Mars!”

Curio’s cameras whirred.
“Recorded. You’re already making history!”

A Martian Sunset
The sun sank slowly, turning the sky a dusky blue‑purple.
“A blue sunset on Mars?” Defne marveled.

Curio explained:

“On Earth sunsets are red‑orange because of our atmosphere’s makeup. Here, the fine dust scatters blue light at dusk.”

Defne engraved that color in their memory.
“I’ll never forget how that sky looked.”

Giants of Volcanoes and Canyons
Curio then led Defne to the rim of a massive shield volcano.

“This is Olympus Mons—the tallest volcano in the Solar System, three times the height of Everest.”

Defne squinted into the distance.
“I feel like I’m in a dream on another world.”

A little farther lay an immense chasm.

“That’s Valles Marineris,” Curio said. “A canyon nearly as long as the continental United States. Mars’s ancient secrets lie within.”

Time to Return
The computer voice sounded again:

“Three minutes until departure for Earth.”

Defne turned to Curio.
“Do you think humans will walk here someday?”

Curio’s sensors tilted upward.

“If we believe it, then yes. And I’ll be here to welcome you back.”

Defne hugged one of Curio’s robotic arms.
“I promise I’ll return.”

Climbing aboard, Defne watched Mars recede like a glowing ember. Their smile beamed bright as the ship rocketed home.

What We Learned on Mars
MARS – The Red Planet
– Fourth planet from the Sun, colored by iron oxide.
– Thin CO₂ atmosphere, once rich with waterways.
– Possible past life remains a mystery.
– Blue sunsets at dusk.
– Home to Olympus Mons (largest volcano) and Valles Marineris (vast canyon).
– Explored by robots today; human footprints may follow tomorrow.

That night, as Defne lay in bed, they whispered once more:

“I left my footprints on Mars… one day they’ll be real.”
