Defne Dances on Venus

That day in school, their teacher had arranged the planets from the inside out.
“Mercury is closest to the Sun, and the second planet is Venus,” they had said.
But one line in the lesson caught Defne’s attention:

“Although Venus most closely resembles Earth, it’s the least hospitable place to live.”

Defne was puzzled.
“How can a planet so much like ours be too dangerous to live on?”
That night, they sat by the window as usual, watching the stars. Yet this time, before closing their eyes, they made a clear wish:

“I want to go to Venus. I want to learn why it’s so hot, why it spins backwards, and all its secrets.”

A beam of light slipped through the window. On the pane, a graceful dance figure began to swirl and transformed into a spaceship. In bold letters it read:

“Heaven’s Backward Dancer: Venus Mission”

The Journey Begins
Defne donned a specially designed “dancer‑astronaut” suit—slim but heat‑resistant, glowing gold.
“Venus shines like gold, so I’ll shine like Venus,” they joked, fastening their helmet.

The ship lifted off. Mercury fell away behind them, the Sun still blazed ahead, but their destination now was that dazzling yellow world: Venus.

A calm computer voice announced:

“Warning: Venus has a surface temperature of 465 °C, thick sulfuric‑acid clouds, and rotates in the opposite direction.”

Defne raised an eyebrow.
“Opposite direction? What does that mean?”

The computer explained:

“Venus spins clockwise—unlike most planets—and very slowly. A single day there lasts longer than its year.”

Defne’s eyes went wide.
“A single day longer than a year? That’s bizarre!”

First Steps on Venus
The ship pierced Venus’s dense cloud layer and gently settled on the surface, bathed in yellow, orange, and crimson light. The air was thick, almost like a glowing haze.

As Defne stepped out, a tall, elegant figure in gold appeared, moving with the grace of a dancer.

“I am Velira, Venus’s dancer. Have you come to learn our planet’s story?”

Defne nodded eagerly.
“Yes! They say you resemble Earth so much—but nobody lives here. Why is that?”

Velira spun, arms rising toward the sky, and spoke softly:
“Once I held hope, just like Earth… But my clouds darkened. Carbon built up so fiercely that I trapped my own heat. Now my air is toxic.”

Defne peered around.
“These clouds are so thick. They let sunlight in but won’t let heat escape, right?”

Velira smiled sadly.
“Exactly. That’s called the greenhouse effect.”

Dancing Winds
Velira took Defne’s hand and they floated just above the surface. Looking up, Defne saw yellow vortexes dancing across the sky.

“Those winds are incredibly fast!”

Velira nodded.
“Though my rotation is slow, my atmosphere moves at storm speeds—up to 360 km/h!”

Defne reflected,
“So you rotate slowly inside, but your clouds whirl wildly outside—like someone who grieves in silence yet smiles to the world.”

Velira’s eyes glistened.
“Perhaps… I try to appear strong, but inside I feel so alone.”

Volcanoes and Plains
They walked on to a vast plain filled with towering volcanoes, molten lava flows, and cracked rocks.

“Why so many volcanoes?” Defne asked.

Velira answered,
“My crust has no plates to shift—so molten rock builds up until it bursts out in massive eruptions. We call those features ‘coronae.’”

Defne knelt beside a cooling lava pit.
“It’s spectacular… but deadly.”

Velira stood solemnly.
“That’s why few visitors remain long. Still, I keep dancing—every planet has its own rhythm.”

Time in Reverse
As dusk fell, Defne dared to ask one more question:
“Why do you spin backwards?”

Velira paused their dance.
“No one knows for certain. Perhaps a colossal impact in the ancient past flipped me. Or maybe my closeness to the Sun shaped me differently. But I do not fear being unique. I spin to my own rhythm.”

Defne beamed.
“Sometimes I feel different, too. But like you, I can dance to my own beat.”

Velira embraced Defne.
“That is why I cherish you, little traveler. Being different is beautiful.”

Time to Go Home
The computer voice chimed once more:

“Three minutes until departure for Earth.”

Defne hugged Velira tightly:
“Thank you for sharing your warmth and your story. I’ll never forget you.”

Velira spun skyward, scattering golden dust into the clouds.
“Keep dancing, Defne—never lose your rhythm.”

The ship ascended, slipping through swirling clouds. Defne’s heart felt both full and light, carrying Venus’s lesson of beauty, danger, and grace.

Back on Earth
When the morning sun filled the room, Defne sprang from bed and opened their journal:

VENUS: Planet of Beauty and Peril
– Most Earth‑like but utterly inhospitable
– Dense atmosphere of sulfuric acid; greenhouse effect drives temperatures to 465 °C
– Rotates backward (clockwise)
– One day lasts longer than one year
– Winds up to 360 km/h and countless volcanoes

Defne looked in the mirror and smiled:
“I’ll dance… just like Venus, to my own rhythm.”
