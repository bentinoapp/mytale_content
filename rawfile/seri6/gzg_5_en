Defne and Jupiter's Great Storm

Defne was lying on the floor of her room, tracing her fingers around a giant planet on the poster.
"Jupiter," she whispered. "The biggest planet. But... why is it so big? Why does it have so many moons? And what’s that red spot?"

Just then, her mother entered the room.
"Do you want something before bed, sweetheart?"
Without a second thought, Defne replied:
"I want to go to Jupiter."

Her mother smiled. "Maybe in your dream," she said. But Defne knew that this wish could really come true. Every night, a path opens among the stars, carrying Defne to the unknown corners of space.

And that night, it happened just like that.

The Giant in the Skies

In the stillness of the night, Defne's room was filled with lights once again. The ceiling cracked open, and a golden hot air balloon floated among the stardust.
This time, it wasn't a spacecraft; a giant balloon was waiting for her. Written on the balloon was:
"Jupiter Winds: A Dance in the Skies"

Defne climbed onto the balloon, fastening her seatbelt tightly.
The computer's voice was different this time—it sounded as though it was speaking from within the wind:
"Welcome to Jupiter. The largest planet in the Solar System. A giant. But be careful—the winds dance, and the storms sing here."

The Gas Giant

The balloon slowly approached Jupiter. There was no surface!
Defne stared in shock.
"We can’t land here because there’s no solid surface!"

The computer confirmed:
"Correct. Jupiter is a gas giant. It’s made of hydrogen and helium. There is no ground to stand on."

The balloon entered the planet's atmosphere. Layer upon layer of clouds appeared: white, yellow, orange, and brown...
They looked like giant belts, each spinning at different speeds and colors.

Defne squinted.
"Are these... wind belts?"
The computer answered:
"Yes. Jupiter's atmosphere is always in motion. Winds can exceed 600 kilometers per hour."

Defne's eyes widened.
"That means winds as fast as a car!"

The Great Red Spot

After a while, a giant whirlpool appeared before them.
It was like a spinning eye, a dark red storm with edges tinged orange.

"This is it!" said Defne. "The famous Great Red Spot!"

As the balloon gently drifted closer, a voice came from within.
"I am... Leka. The heart of Jupiter. I've been here for 350 years. I never stop spinning."

Defne pressed her face against the balloon's window.
"Has this storm really been going on for that long?"

Leka roared:
"Yes. I’ve lasted long enough to make Earth's hurricanes jealous. I was once much bigger. Though I've shrunk, my power remains!"

Defne held her breath.
"Is it possible to enter it?"
The computer warned:
"That's dangerous. But watching is safe."

The balloon began to slowly spin around the storm. The winds howled, and the clouds swirled like waves.

The Moon Orchestra

After a while, Defne noticed the giant dots surrounding Jupiter.
"What are these? They look like small planets."
"These are moons," said the computer. "Jupiter has over 95 moons. The most famous are the Galilean moons: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto."

When Defne heard "Europa," she turned her head.
"There’s an ocean there, isn’t there?"
The computer replied:
"Yes. It’s believed that beneath Europa's icy shell, there is a huge ocean. Maybe there’s even life."

Defne’s eyes lit up.
"Then one day, let’s go to Europa too!"

Meeting Ganymede

At that moment, the balloon approached Jupiter’s largest moon, Ganymede.
Its surface was covered with grey and white streaks.
Though Defne didn’t step out, she watched from the window.
Suddenly, a bright light appeared, and a voice was heard:

"I am Ganymede. The largest moon in the Solar System. I'm even bigger than Mercury!"

Defne widened her eyes.
"Can a moon be bigger than a planet?"
"Yes!" said Ganymede. "But I still continue to orbit Jupiter."

The Power of Gravity

Defne looked up at the sky.
"Jupiter is so big... it pulls everything towards itself."
The computer responded:
"Jupiter’s mass is twice the combined mass of all the other planets. That’s why it has such a strong gravitational pull. It can even divert asteroids."

Defne thought for a moment.
"So sometimes, it protects us too?"
"Yes," said the computer. "Jupiter can protect Earth from some asteroids."

Time to Return

As the rainbow-like layers of Jupiter faded behind them, the balloon began to rise.
Defne waved out of the window.
"Goodbye, giant planet. You are like an amazing orchestra with your storms and moons."

Leka’s voice came one last time:
"Remember, Defne. There’s a rhythm inside every storm. Find your own music."

From Defne’s Journal: The Secrets of Jupiter

JUPITER: The Largest Planet in the Solar System

It is a gas giant. There is no solid surface.

The Great Red Spot is a giant storm that has lasted for hundreds of years.

It has more than 95 moons. The most famous are: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto.

There may be an ocean beneath Europa.

Jupiter’s gravitational pull is so strong that it can deflect asteroids.

That night, as Defne lay in her bed, she murmured to herself:
"I’ve started to love storms... especially when there’s dancing inside them."
