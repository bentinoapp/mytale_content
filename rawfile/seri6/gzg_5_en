Defne and Jupiter’s Great Storm
Defne lay on the floor of the room, tracing the outline of a massive planet on the poster.
“Jupiter,” Defne whispered. “The largest planet. But… why is it so big? Why does it have so many moons? And what is that red spot?”

Just then, Defne’s mother entered the room.
“Do you want anything before bedtime, dear?”
Defne answered without a moment’s hesitation:
“I want to go to Jupiter.”

Mother smiled. “Maybe in your dreams,” she said. But Defne knew this wish could truly come true—because every night, a path opened among the stars, carrying Defne to unknown corners of space.

And that night, it happened just like that.

The Giant in the Skies
In the stillness of the night, Defne’s room filled with lights once more. The ceiling cracked open, and through the stardust drifted a golden‑yellow hot‑air balloon.
This time, it wasn’t a spacecraft but a massive balloon awaiting Defne. On its side was written:

“Jupiter’s Winds: A Dance in the Skies”

Defne climbed into the balloon and fastened the harness tightly.
The computer’s voice sounded different this time—as if speaking from within the wind:

“Welcome to Jupiter. The largest planet in the Solar System. A giant. But be careful—the winds dance and the storms sing here.”

The Gas Giant
The balloon slowly approached Jupiter. There was no solid surface! Defne gazed in astonishment.

“We can’t land here because there is no ground!”
The computer confirmed:
“That’s right. Jupiter is a gas giant composed of hydrogen and helium. There’s no solid ground underfoot.”

Layer upon layer of clouds awaited: white, yellow, orange, and brown…
They looked like enormous bands, each a different color and spinning at its own speed. Defne squinted to get a closer look.

“Are those… wind belts?”
The computer replied:
“Yes. Jupiter’s atmosphere is in constant motion. Winds can exceed 600 kilometers per hour.”
Defne’s eyes widened.
“That means winds as fast as a speeding car!”

The Great Red Spot
After a while, a colossal vortex appeared before them—like a giant rotating eye, deep red with edges tinged orange.

“There it is!” said Defne. “The famous Great Red Spot!”

As the balloon drifted closer, a voice rumbled from within the storm:

“I am the Spot. The heart of Jupiter. I’ve been here for 350 years. I never stop spinning.”

Defne pressed against the window.

“Has this storm really lasted that long?”
The Spot thundered:
“Yes. I’ve lasted longer than any hurricane on Earth. I was once much larger. Though I’ve shrunk, my strength remains!”

Defne held the breath.

“Can we go inside it?”
The computer warned:
“Dangerous. But observing is safe.”

The balloon began to circle the storm slowly. The winds howled as clouds streamed in rolling waves.

The Orchestra of Moons
After a time, Defne noticed enormous dots circling Jupiter.

“What are those? They look like little planets.”
“Those are moons,” the computer said. “Jupiter has over 95 moons. The most famous are the Galilean moons: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto.”

When Defne heard “Europa,” the head turned sharply.

“There’s an ocean there, right?”
The computer responded:
“Yes. Beneath Europa’s icy shell, scientists believe there is a vast ocean. There might even be life.”
Defne exclaimed with excitement:
“Then one day, let’s go to Europa too!”

Meeting Ganymede
At that moment, the balloon approached Ganymede, Jupiter’s largest moon. Its surface was streaked in gray and white. Although Defne could not set foot there, Defne watched through the window. Suddenly, a brilliant light shone and a voice spoke:

“I am Ganymede. The largest moon in the Solar System—bigger even than Mercury!”
Defne’s eyes widened again.
“Can a moon really be larger than a planet?”
“Yes!” said Ganymede. “But I still orbit Jupiter.”

The Power of Gravity
Defne gazed skyward.

“Jupiter is so massive… it pulls everything toward itself.”
The computer replied:
“Jupiter’s mass is twice that of all the other planets combined. Its gravitational field is so strong it can even divert asteroids from their paths.”
Defne thought for a moment.
“So sometimes it might protect us?”
“Yes,” said the computer. “Jupiter can shield Earth from some asteroids.”

Time to Return
As the rainbow‑layered bands of Jupiter receded, the balloon began to ascend. Defne waved from the window.

“Farewell, giant planet. With your storms and your moons, you’re like a magnificent orchestra.”
The Spot’s voice came one last time:
“Remember, Defne. There is a rhythm in every storm. Find your own music.”

From Defne’s Notebook: The Secrets of Jupiter
JUPITER: The Largest Planet in the Solar System

A gas giant with no solid surface.

The Great Red Spot is a massive storm that has raged for centuries.

Over 95 moons; most famous are Io, Europa, Ganymede, Callisto.

A vast ocean may lie beneath Europa’s icy shell.

Jupiter’s gravitational pull is so strong it can divert asteroids.

That night, while lying in bed, Defne murmured:

“I have begun to love storms… especially when there is dancing within them.”
