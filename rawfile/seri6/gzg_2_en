Defne and the Lost Planet Mercury

When Defne arrived home from school, they tossed their backpack onto the couch and dashed to their room. That day in class they’d done an experiment about space. The teacher had said, “There are eight planets in the Solar System,” but one question kept tugging at Defne’s mind:

“Where is Mercury? It’s the closest planet to the Sun, yet we hardly ever hear about it. Why is it so quiet?”

A spark of curiosity ignited in Defne’s heart. That night, when the stars came out, they opened their window, sat down as always, closed their eyes, and whispered:

“I want to find Mercury…”

Suddenly, the ceiling of their room glowed. The walls shifted into a gateway to space, revealing a sleek, grey‑silver spaceship with wings. In golden letters across its side read:

Mission to the Sun’s Nearest Neighbor: Mercury

A Hot, Silent Trip
Without hesitation, Defne boarded the ship. The hatch closed, engines hummed, and inside they found sunglasses, cooling equipment, and a special suit.

“It’s going to be really hot,” Defne muttered, already breaking into a sweat.

A computer voice guided them:

“Destination: Mercury. Surface temperatures can reach 430 °C by day and plummet to –180 °C at night.”

Defne’s eyes widened.

“How can it both burn and freeze in the same place?”

The computer explained:

“Mercury has almost no atmosphere, so it cannot retain heat.”

Peering through the viewport, they flew ever closer to the Sun, bathed in a blinding golden glow. Finally Mercury appeared: a silent, cratered world of grey rock.

The Planet’s Surface
When the ship landed, Defne stepped onto a rocky, slippery plain.

“It looks like the Moon,” they observed.

A cloud of dust drifted by, revealing a figure stepping out of the haze. The visitor wore a crown of stone and a cloak sprinkled with stardust.

“I am Murkan, spirit of Mercury. Have you come seeking me?”

Defne’s eyes grew large.

“Yes! Nobody talks much about you. Why would a planet hide away?”

Murkan sighed.

“Mercury is ancient and sun‑scorched. Though I live beside the Sun, my face is so burned that everyone turns their gaze elsewhere.”

Defne nodded thoughtfully.

“Do you have secrets of your own? Rings or moons like the other planets?”

Murkan smiled.

“No moons or rings. But I orbit the Sun faster than any other planet—one Mercury year lasts only 88 Earth days!”

Defne’s hands flew up in surprise.

“So one of your years is less than three of our months!”

One Day on Mercury
Murkan extended a hand.

“Come. I’ll show you what a single day is like here.”

As they walked, Defne noticed the Sun rising very slowly—but the pattern was unlike anything on Earth.

“Here, a single rotation takes 59 Earth days. One Mercury day is almost two of your months, yet a Mercury year is shorter than a single Earth season!”

Defne scratched their head.

“It’s confusing but fascinating. Waiting 59 days for the Sun to rise… yet completing a year in just 88 days!”

Murkan laughed.

“To understand time, you must know not only clocks but a planet’s unique motions.”

The Sun’s Shadowed Face
Climbing onto a nearby rock, Defne saw something striking.

“One side is scorching hot, the other side freezing cold!”

Murkan nodded.

“Yes. With no atmosphere, heat doesn’t transfer. Staying in the shade can save your life.”

Defne picked up a dark stone.

“These rocks feel like Moon rocks, but darker.”

Murkan explained:

“Mercury’s surface is ancient, scarred by countless meteors. My largest crater is called the Caloris Basin.”

Defne’s eyes lit up.

“I’ll tell my class about that—Caloris Basin, what a name!”

Time to Return
The sky at Mercury’s horizon began to glow with dawn. The ship’s computer announced:

“Five minutes until departure for Earth.”

Murkan took Defne’s hands.

“Don’t forget me, little traveler. Mercury may be silent, but it’s full of wisdom. Here you learn endurance under heat, strength in solitude.”

Defne hugged Murkan.

“I’ll never forget. And I’ll share your story. You’re not lost—just misunderstood.”

Climbing aboard, Defne watched as Mercury shrank below until it disappeared from view.

Back Home
Dawn was breaking as Defne awoke in their own bed, sunlight streaming in. They rushed to their desk and wrote in big letters:

MERCURY: The Solar System’s Quietest Neighbor
– Gray, crater‑pocked surface
– Virtually no atmosphere
– 430 °C by day, –180 °C by night
– One year = 88 Earth days; one day = 59 Earth days
– No rings, no moons—yet wisdom untold

That morning, when the teacher asked, “Who’d like to give a presentation on a planet?” Defne was the first to raise their hand.

“I’d love to tell you all about Mercury—it has its own fascinating story…”
