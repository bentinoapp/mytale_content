Defne at the Library
One morning, while having breakfast, Defne’s father returned from the mailbox holding a colorful envelope.
“A special invitation for Defne has arrived!” he exclaimed excitedly.
Defne dried their hands and opened the envelope.
Printed in large letters was the message:
“Children’s Day at the City Public Library! Tales, book games, and discoveries await you!”

Defne’s eyes lit up.
“A real library? I’ve only seen the school library before.”
Their mother smiled and said,
“This is a much larger place—shelves full of books, quiet corners, the smell of books… Are you ready?”

Defne immediately began getting ready. They packed their favorite notebook, pencil case, Fluffy, and a set of colorful pens into their bag.
“Maybe I’ll draw the books I read,” they thought.
Their mother handed over a jacket.
“It might be a bit cool in there; books love silence.”

On the way, Defne’s mind buzzed with a thousand questions.
“Do you think books talk? Could I whisper to them?”
Their father shook his head and replied,
“Books don’t talk to you, but as you read, you’ll feel like you’re talking with them.”

When the library building came into view, Defne stopped in awe.
A tall glass building with huge trees in front and a large sign above it declared:
“City Public Library”

Inside, the walls were decorated with illustrations of books, soft reading cushions were scattered about, and children wandered quietly. At the entrance, there was a display board that read:
“Welcome to the Reading Adventure!”
In colorful letters, the board spelled out:
“COURAGE – KNOWLEDGE – IMAGINATION – FRIENDSHIP – ADVENTURE”

A friendly staff member approached and said,
“Hello, Defne. Would you like to be our library explorer today?”
Defne nodded excitedly,
“I’m ready!”

The staff member—Emily—handed Defne a small card.
“There are tasks in each corner of our library. Complete them all and you will collect stars on this card!”

First Stop: Story Corner.
Soft cushions, colorful books…
As Defne wandered among the books, soft whispers seemed to be heard. One book, as if inviting a touch, was titled:
“Golden-Hearted Bird”

In the tale, a little child finds an injured bird and, by helping it, makes friends with the animals of the forest until the bird finally leads the child to a magical forest.
As Defne turned the pages, their heart grew warm.
“This story feels like me—I once helped a bird too,” they thought.
Upon finishing the task, Emily awarded the first star.

Second Stop: Knowledge Tunnel.
This section was filled with encyclopedias, atlases, and science books.
Defne opened a book titled:
“The Little Scholar’s Space Journey”
Planets, stars, black holes…
A small question on the page asked,
“Why does the moon shine?”
Defne pondered and answered,
“Because it reflects the sun’s light.”
With a smile, Emily gave the second star.

Third Stop: Book Detective Game.
The task read:
“A four-letter, mischievous rabbit who searches for carrots in the garden.”
Defne solved the clue by exclaiming,
“Peter Rabbit!”
And the third star found its place on the card.

Fourth Stop: Creative Writing Table.
Defne picked up a pen and began to think.
They wrote a story titled “Fluffy and the Moonlight Forest.”
In the tale, one night Fluffy visits a forest in a dream, where moonlight speaks and plays with the stars.
When the writing was finished, Emily came by and said,
“What a wonderful imagination! Stories are like the voice of our hearts.”
The fourth star was attached.

Fifth Stop: Garden of Silence.
In this glass-enclosed corner, gentle bird songs could be heard.
Defne selected a small book titled:
“The World’s Quietest Hour”
Inside, a child was searching for silence.
As Defne read, they felt as if they could hear their own inner voice.
“Sometimes silence is like music,” they thought.
The fifth star was earned!

Finally, Emily returned once more.
“Reach out your hand, Defne.”
She presented a Library Explorer Certificate, inscribed in golden letters with the message:
“Thank you to the brave heart that discovered the world of books today.”
Along with a small gift—a bookmark and a notebook.

On the way out, Defne met another child named Ella.
“I read ‘Golden-Hearted Bird’ too!” Ella exclaimed.
Defne’s excitement grew.
“Then we love the same story!”
Together, they sat near the library exit and talked about their books.
Defne whispered at last,
“Books are not only about knowledge; they also connect us to one another.”

When they arrived home, Defne immediately opened their diary and wrote:
“Today, I spoke with books. They showed me other worlds. I learned, I dreamed, and even silence told me a story. The best part was making a new friend. Libraries are quiet, yet they create loud emotions inside us.”

Cradling Fluffy in their arms, Defne said,
“Tonight, I will read you the story I wrote, and then choose a new book for us.”
And tucking the magic world of books under their pillow, Defne fell asleep in peaceful dreams.
