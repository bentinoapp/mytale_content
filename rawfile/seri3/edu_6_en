[HERO] and the Water Drop Team

One morning, the moment [HERO] woke up, they dashed straight to the kitchen. They had breakfast, brushed their teeth, got dressed—but forgot one thing…

To drink water.

At school, [HERO] hardly noticed thirst all day. Sometimes they had a glass, sometimes none. They ran, played, and sweated, but drinking water always stayed at the back of their mind.

Their mother often reminded them, “Don’t forget to drink water!”
“Okay!” said [HERO], but more often than not, they only said it and didn’t drink.

That afternoon, [HERO] came home feeling a bit tired, with a slight headache. They opened their book but found it hard to focus on the words. Their hands even felt a little dry.

Just then, the water bottle on their desk trembled.

Shhrr… plop… swoosh!

[HERO]’s eyes went wide. Three tiny lights emerged from the bottle—round, clear, sparkling creatures dancing like living droplets!

“Hi [HERO]!” said the first drop. “I’m Viva, the energy specialist!”
“I’m Sparkle, in charge of skin and eyes!” said the second.
“And I’m Balance, your body’s stabilizer!” said the third.

[HERO] stared at the bottle in amazement. “Did you… come out of the water?”

Viva bounced forward. “We’re the Water Drop Team! Our mission is to protect your body’s systems. But… we need your help.”

Sparkle sighed. “You’ve had very little water today. Your cells are cramped, your eyes are strained, your skin is drying out…”

Balance shook their head. “Your muscles are off‑balance. Dehydration is serious!”

[HERO] hung their head in shame. “But I always forget to drink…”

A door opened in the wall, revealing a glowing tunnel. The drops led [HERO] inside. There stood a vast network—it was [HERO]’s body! Veins flowed like rivers; cells rushed around like tiny workers.

But things weren’t going well.

One cell scratched its head. “They said oxygen was coming here—but it’s still not arrived!”
Another shouted, “No water—muscles are tense!”
The “Clarity Crew” behind the eyes struggled to wipe their lenses clear.

Sparkle whispered, “All of this is happening because of dehydration.”

Viva pressed a button. On a giant screen appeared:

[HERO]’s Daily Water Log
Morning: 0 glasses
Noon: 1 glass
Evening: 0 glasses
Total: 1 glass
Goal: 5–6 glasses!

[HERO] buried their face in their hands. “Is drinking water really that important?”

Balance spoke gently. “Water isn’t just to quench thirst. It powers us. It sharpens your mind, steadies your heart. Drinking water is showing respect for life.”

At that moment a loud clang rang out. An alarm blared in the stomach area:
“GastroRiver contracting! Cells are parched!”

Viva hurried to [HERO]’s side. “You need water right away. Come on—let’s start together!”

Back in the real world, [HERO] grabbed their clear bottle on the desk. They took a sip. As each drop slid down, they felt refreshed. They drank another glass—and then another.

Inside their body, tiny worker cells jumped for joy:

“Water’s here!”
“We’re energized!”
“It feels like lemonade!”

Sparkle rushed to the tear ducts. “Clarity is up from 40 percent to 80 percent!”
Balance headed to the muscles. “Your muscles are working much more steadily.”

To remember this lesson, [HERO] wrote on a bright card in big letters:

SUPPORT THE WATER DROP TEAM!
Morning, upon waking: 1 glass
Before school: 1 glass
After school: 1 glass
After playing: 1 glass
At dinner: 1 glass

They stuck the card to their bottle and drew three tiny drops: Viva, Sparkle, and Balance.

Now, every time they drank, [HERO] imagined the team smiling—and could feel how happy their body was.

A week later, the teacher asked in class, “Has anyone picked up a healthy habit this week?”

[HERO] raised their hand. “I’ve been drinking water every day. I learned drinking water is not just something you do—it’s how you live.”

The class applauded. The teacher smiled. “Well said, [HERO]. Caring for our bodies is one way to show ourselves love.”

From that day on, the Water Drop Team continued to wink from inside [HERO]’s bottle. They might not be visible, but with every sip, they carried out their mission with pride.

And [HERO]?
They spent each day stronger, clearer, and happier—one glass at a time.
