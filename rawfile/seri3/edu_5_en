[HERO] and the Sleepy Pillow

As the silence of the night slowly enveloped the street, the yellow lights in the windows of houses were going out one by one. The children had already brushed their teeth, put on their pajamas, listened to their bedtime stories, and fallen asleep.

But in one house, the light was still on.

In [HERO]'s room...

[HERO] was lying in bed, but their eyes were wide open. Holding a toy in one hand and books beside them, they were glancing at the tablet screen.

“There’s still some time... I don’t need to wake up early tomorrow,” mumbled [HERO].

It was 10:45 PM.

[HERO] had a habit of being late for school the next morning. Waking up in the morning became a big adventure: hiding under the duvet, rubbing their eyes, and then getting out of bed after their mother’s fourth “Come on now!”

They always barely made it to school on time. Sometimes they skipped breakfast, and on some days, they even wore their pajamas inside out.

But that night, everything was going to change.

Just as [HERO] was playing a tiny game on the tablet, suddenly the screen went dark and froze. At that moment, a soft snoring sound came from inside the pillow.

“Hooorrr... hiiiir... zzzz…”

[HERO] turned their head. Was that... the pillow?

Yes! The pillow was moving, as if it was breathing.

Then suddenly, the fluffy pillow split in half, and a tiny creature popped out! It was white, soft, with eyes that gleamed like milk foam. It was wearing a blue pajama suit.

“Hello!” said the little creature. “I’m Uyki, from the Sleepy Pillows Association. And there’s a big problem!”

[HERO] blinked. “Did you come out of the pillow?”

Uyki shook their head anxiously. “Yes! And right now, the Kingdom of Sleep is in danger!”

Uyki threw a small light orb towards the ceiling. In an instant, the room transformed. The walls turned into a starry night sky. The ceiling opened up like the sky. A river of dreams was flowing down from the sky.

But the river was getting clogged somewhere.

“This is the Sleep River,” said Uyki. “When every child sleeps on time, this river flows smoothly, and children reach Dreamland. But when some children go to bed late, the river narrows, gets murky, and is delayed.”

[HERO] looked on in curiosity. “So, what does this have to do with me?”

Uyki furrowed their brow and pointed to a small clock. The clock was labeled “Sleep Calendar.” And [HERO]'s calendar was completely covered in red.

“Your sleep is irregular, [HERO]. Your body can’t wake up fresh in the morning, you struggle at school. Your dreams are incomplete. You can’t reach the Kingdom of Sleep.”

They paused for a moment. “And... your pillows are even sad.”

[HERO] was surprised. “The pillows?”

Just then, the spare pillows at the corner of the bed came to life one by one. Their eyes were looking down. They weren’t speaking, but their faces were saddened.

Uyki continued. “Pillows are here for sleep. They don’t just go under your head; their job is to take you to Dreamland. But as you stay up late, their power fades.”

For the first time, [HERO] thought about how tired they felt when they woke up in the morning, how they could barely open their eyes on the way to school... how they yawned during lessons...

“So, what can I do?” [HERO] asked.

Uyki smiled. “That’s why I’m here! Now, we’re going to create a Sleep Journey Routine Map together.”

A scroll appeared from the bedhead:

[HERO]'s Sleep Journey Map
9:00 PM – Brush your teeth.
9:15 PM – Put on your pajamas.
9:30 PM – Story or book time.
9:45 PM – Dim the lights.
10:00 PM – Begin transition to sleep!

“If you stick to this plan, the Sleep River will flow again,” Uyki said. “And Dreamland will be waiting for you.”

[HERO] thought for a moment. Games, videos, staying up late... but then they looked into Uyki’s sparkling eyes.

“Alright,” [HERO] said determinedly. “I’ll start tonight!”

Uyki jumped for joy. The pillows spun with happiness. The red areas on the calendar slowly turned yellow, then green.

[HERO] brushed their teeth, put on their pajamas, read a short story, and turned off the light.

As soon as [HERO] laid their head on the pillow... the Sleep River gently began to flow. Dreamland sparkled brightly.

And Uyki softly whispered in their ear:

“Whenever you go to sleep on time, I’ll always be here.”

The next morning, for the first time, [HERO] woke up before the alarm. Their eyes were shining, their body light.

When [HERO]'s mother saw them walking into the kitchen, she was surprised.

“You’re so energetic this morning!”

[HERO] smiled. “Because those who sleep on time wake up like heroes.”

From that day on, Uyki was by [HERO]'s bedside every night. Maybe they couldn’t be seen, but the joy inside the soft pillow showed [HERO] the respect they had for sleep.

And the Kingdom of Sleep was safe once again.
