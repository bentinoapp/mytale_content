[HERO] and Toilet Time

[HERO] loved playing games. Especially on the colorful rug they had spread out, spending hours with their toys. Sometimes they built towers with blocks, sometimes they created a forest with plush animals, and other times they held races with toy cars.

But [HERO] had a small habit… Even when they felt the need to use the bathroom, they didn’t want to interrupt their play. “I’ll play a little more, then I’ll go,” they always said.

Sometimes that “little more” kept stretching on and on. Then, when they finally ran to the bathroom, they struggled, dropped things in haste, and sometimes didn’t make it in time. They felt embarrassed, frustrated, and sometimes they even cried.

Their family was understanding. “It’s okay, [HERO], but if you listen to your body’s signals, you won’t have this problem,” said their mother.

But [HERO] always wanted just a bit more play.

That day, they were building a huge space station with a new LEGO set. They were so excited that they didn’t get up for hours. For a moment they felt a gentle pressure in their belly, but thought, “Just a little longer,” and kept going.

Just as they placed the final piece… a small accident happened.

Frozen, surprised, and a little upset, [HERO] stayed still. They quickly changed clothes and tidied the room, but their spirits stayed low.

That night, as they lay down and closed their eyes, a whisper reached them.

“Tick… tock… tick… tock…”

They looked at the clock. It appeared normal, but the sound filled the room.

Suddenly the clock on the wall began to glow. The hour and minute hands lifted off and started spinning. Then a tiny door opened at its center.

A slender figure in a jacket and glasses stepped out. Their head was a clock, and their hands were covered with tiny alarm bells.

“Hello, [HERO],” they said kindly. “I’m Zamzi, the guardian of Toilet Time.”

[HERO] sat up in bed, astonished. “Toilet… Time?”

Zamzi nodded. “Yes. Everyone has an invisible clock inside them. A gentle pressure in the belly, a flutter in the legs, a feeling of restlessness—those are our signals. But lately you’ve been silencing us.”

[HERO] lowered their head. “I get carried away with my games.”

“Forgetting is normal,” Zamzi said. “But we’re here to remind you. If you ignore our signals, it’s not just accidents that happen. Your body grows tired, uncomfortable.”

A whistle blew, and the ceiling opened. [HERO] found themselves inside a giant clock tower.

Each floor held a different section:

Bladder Center: alarm bells ringing, tiny droplets shouting, “We need to be released!”
Nerve Line: “We sent an alert but received no response,” they said.
Cauliflower Council (representing the brain): “Our hero’s attention was elsewhere…”

Zamzi climbed to a high platform. “This is the main control room of Toilet Time.”

At the center spun a large time wheel. Its indicators read Ready, Warning, Urgent.

Zamzi turned to [HERO]. “If you turn this wheel at the right time, everything goes smoothly. But if you’re late, the system breaks down.”

[HERO] nodded solemnly. “What can I do?”

Zamzi adjusted their glasses. “I will give you a Toilet Calendar. Every morning, at midday, and in the evening, set reminders to go. Listen to your body. Don’t fear pausing your play—your health is more important.”

They lifted a finger and placed a tiny clock in [HERO]’s palm. The face read Your Time.

“This clock is invisible but always with you. If you listen, your body will thank you.”

The next morning, [HERO] remembered the clock as soon as they woke. Whether dream or reality, they made a choice:

Today, they would heed every signal.

After breakfast, they went to the bathroom. At school recess, they went again. That evening, when their body nudged them, they paused their game and headed there.

They enjoyed a day without accidents.

A week later, during a lesson on Daily Routines, the teacher asked, “Has anyone picked up a new habit?”

[HERO] raised their hand. “I learned to notice my bathroom signals. My body has been speaking quietly to me.”

The teacher smiled. “Wonderful! Listening to yourself is the greatest care you can give.”

From that day on, [HERO] learned to stop, even in the middle of a game.

Because your body’s messages cannot wait.

And Zamzi? They remain on duty in their secret clock.
