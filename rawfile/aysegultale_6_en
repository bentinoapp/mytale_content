Defne and the Amusement Park Adventure
One morning, Defne walked into the kitchen and found their father dealing with a large box. On the box was colorful writing: "AMUSEMENT PARK TICKETS."
“What? We’re going to the amusement park?!” Defne shouted with joy.
Their mother took a sip of coffee and smiled.
“Yes, dear. Tonight, a sparkling amusement park is waiting for you.”

Defne jumped with excitement and lifted up Fluffy.
“Get ready, Fluffy! Tonight we’ll spin under the stars, jump around, and eat cotton candy!”

All day, Defne could hardly stay still from excitement. In the afternoon, preparations began with their mother.
“I should wear comfy shoes,” said Defne. “We’ll be running around!”
Their mother packed a small flashlight, a spare mask, and some tissues.
“It might be crowded. We should be prepared.”

At sunset, their father got the car ready. On the way, Defne stared out the window. The sky had turned into shades of pink and purple, and the air had grown slightly cooler.
“I’ll be the first to spot the lights of the amusement park,” Defne said, squinting.
And indeed, soon the lights of the giant Rainbow Wheel came into view. It spun like a rainbow in the sky.

At the entrance, a clown greeted them with balloons in hand.
“Welcome, little one,” said the clown, bowing. “Tonight, you’ll get closer to the sky than anyone!”
Defne giggled.
“Really? Then I need to ride the Ferris wheel first!”

After getting their tickets, they crossed the big plaza. On the right was a carousel, on the left bumper cars, and ahead was a dancer ride adorned with colorful lights. Defne headed straight for the Ferris wheel.
As they stepped into the cabin, their father held their hand.
“Ready?”
Defne closed their eyes and nodded.

As the wheel rose, the city below grew smaller and the sky wider. The moon looked enormous.
“We’re almost touching the stars!” said Defne.
Their father smiled.
“Sometimes when you rise the highest, you find the calmest place inside.”
Defne stared silently for a while. The wind played with their hair, and their heart beat peacefully.

When they came down, the next stop was the bumper cars!
Defne got into a car with their mother and laughed joyfully while steering. Another child approached.
“Wanna crash?”
Defne turned the wheel sharply.
“Watch out! The queen of the amusement park is coming!”

After crashing, they became friends. The child’s name was Liam, and they were about the same age.
“Let’s go get some cotton candy,” said Liam.
Defne asked for permission from their mother and returned with a giant pink cloud in hand.
“It’s like a fluffy cloud… but sweet!” they said, taking a bite.

Soon, an announcement came over the speakers:
“Shadow Theater begins in 10 minutes!”
Defne got excited.
“I’ve never seen a shadow story before!”

They entered a small tent. Behind a curtain, puppets, hands, and lights were telling a story.
A bird was flying with the wind, and a little bear followed along. In the end, the bird reached its nest, and the bear found new friends.
Defne was deeply moved.
“Mom… it feels like I was part of that story.”

As they were walking out, Defne noticed something on the ground.
“It looks like a tiny version of Fluffy!” they said, looking at a plush bunny.
But it wasn’t alone—there were other items too.
“Looks like a kid dropped their toy bag.”

Defne immediately went to a park attendant.
“These look lost. Maybe someone’s looking for them?”
The attendant smiled.
“Thank you for your thoughtfulness. Sometimes finding a toy is like finding a child’s heart.”

While walking, they saw a child crying beside their mother.
“My bag! My bunny is gone!”
Defne ran over.
“I think I found it!”
The child’s eyes sparkled, and the mother thanked them warmly.
“You’re a hero,” said the child.
Defne smiled.
“I just looked carefully.”

At the end of the night, Defne rode the carousel. On the spinning, music-filled platform, they closed their eyes.
“I feel like a royal…”

As they left the amusement park, the air had grown cooler. Just a few stars remained in the sky, and the lights were slowly dimming.
Before getting into the car, Defne turned and looked back at the park.
“Today I didn’t just have fun… I helped, I learned, and I saw the sky.”

When they got home, Defne immediately opened the diary and wrote:
“Today I got a little closer to the stars. It was a night like a dream. The amusement park was fun, but the best part was returning a lost bunny to its owner. And the story told by the shadows… Today will never be forgotten.”

Defne placed Fluffy next to the bed.
“One day, I’ll take you on the Ferris wheel too,” they whispered.

And with the lights of the amusement park in their heart, Defne fell into a deep sleep.
