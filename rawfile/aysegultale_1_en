Defne on Vacation

It was the last day of school, and Defne woke up early in the morning. As soon as she opened her eyes, she ran to the window. Sunlight peeked through the curtains.
"Today is report card day!" she said with excitement. She grabbed her teddy bear, Fluffy, hugged it tight, and said,
“Vacation starts today, Fluffy, vacation!”

She jumped out of bed with joy. After bouncing a bit in her pajamas, she rushed to her closet and chose her favorite dress: a yellow one with tiny butterflies on it. Her mother braided her hair into two neat plaits. As she clipped the small butterfly pins in place, her mother smiled:
“You look beautiful today, Defne. After you get your report card, we’ll celebrate together.”

When she went down to the kitchen, her dad had already set the breakfast table. There were eggs, olives, cheese, and her favorite: strawberry jam. And a surprise—a glass of strawberry milk!
“Eat up,” her father said. “Because we have a surprise plan waiting for you.”

After receiving her report card, Defne got a big hug from her teacher.
“Defne, you’ve made wonderful progress this year. Your curious questions, bright smile, and kindness to your friends made me so happy.”
Defne lowered her head slightly, but her eyes were shining.
“Thank you, teacher!”

When school ended, her parents picked her up. Her dad had already packed the trunk of the car.
“Ready, little vacationer?” he said.
Defne looked surprised: “We’re going on a trip? Where?”
Her mom winked: “It’s a surprise! You’ll see when we get there.”

On the road, Defne gazed out the window as they played games.
“Count the red cars you see!” her mom said.
“One... two... three!” Defne shouted with glee.
Then her dad turned on the car radio. They sang along and tapped to the rhythm with their hands.

During the ride, her dad pointed out animals.
“Look, Defne, those are sheep. Their wool keeps you warm in sweaters.”
“What about the chickens?” Defne asked curiously.
“They lay eggs every morning, just like the ones you ate for breakfast.”
Defne nodded in amazement. “So they all work hard, too!”

A few hours later, they arrived at a small, cozy inn by the sea. Defne couldn’t believe her eyes. The deep blue sea, the white sand, and the endless sky...
“This is the most beautiful place I’ve ever seen!” she shouted.

While her mom unpacked the room, Defne put on her swimsuit right away. She held her father’s hand and they ran toward the sea.
At first, the water was chilly, but once she got used to it, she splashed around laughing. Near the shore, she and her dad built a sandcastle. They decorated it with pebbles, flowers, and a seashell.
“This is our vacation castle!” Defne said proudly.

That evening, they took a walk along the beach as the sun set. Her mom gave her a small trash bag.
“The sea is like our home,” her mother said. “Keeping it clean is very important.”
When Defne spotted a plastic bottle on the ground, she picked it up right away.
“Sea creatures could get hurt by these, right Mom?”
“Yes, sweetheart. That’s why we need to be careful and caring,” her mom replied.

The next morning, Defne woke up early. There was morning exercise in the inn’s garden. She warmed up with the other children by dancing and then they all had breakfast together. At breakfast, they talked about where tomatoes and olives grow.
“I want to see an olive tree,” Defne said.
The innkeeper smiled: “Today I’ll take you to a little olive grove.”

In the olive grove, Defne found a tiny turtle.
“Dad! Can I take it home?”
Her dad smiled:
“Animals are happiest in their own homes, in nature. But we can give it some water to help it cool down.”
Defne gently carried some water in her palm and poured it over the turtle.
“Bye-bye, little friend,” she said, waving.

One day, the inn organized a story time in the garden. Each child brought a book. Defne took out her favorite: Lucy in the Forest. She loved reading.
Her mom sat next to her and whispered:
“Isn’t reading the best part of vacation?”
Defne nodded:
“Books let me discover new places—even outside of vacation!”

She met other children during the holiday, too. She became best friends with a girl named Lily. They collected seashells, skipped stones, and dreamed together.
“When we grow up, let’s be mermaids!” said Lily.
Defne laughed: “Okay, but I need to learn how to swim first!”

One evening after dinner, Defne’s family set the table together. Defne handed out napkins, her dad placed the glasses, and her mom brought the salad.
“Working together is really nice,” said Defne.
Her mom smiled:
“Even on vacation, we should remember our responsibilities.”

Every day of the vacation, Defne kept a diary. She drew pictures, wrote about the animals she saw, and described the games she played with Lily.
“This will be my vacation diary,” she said. “I’ll keep it forever.”

On the last night, they sat on the beach under a sky full of stars. Her dad pointed to one of them.
“Look, Defne, the stars are with us, even on vacation.”
Defne smiled.
“I’ll keep what I learned on this trip inside me, like the stars.”

When the holiday ended, Defne felt a little sad but very happy. On the way back, she held a postcard she had written for Lily.
“I’ll send this with Mom when we get home,” she said.

Her mom whispered in her ear:
“A new school year means new adventures. Don’t forget to share all the beautiful things you learned this holiday with your friends.”
Defne winked:
“Okay, Mom. I tucked this vacation in my heart. Now it’s time for new discoveries!”
