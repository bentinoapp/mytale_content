[Defne on Holiday]

On the last day of school, Defne woke up early. As soon as the eyes opened, Defne ran to the window. Sunlight was streaming through the curtains.
“It’s report card day!” said Defne with excitement. Hugging the teddy bear, Cuddles, tightly:
“Holiday begins, Cuddles! Holiday!”

Jumping out of bed with joy, Defne bounced a little on the pajamas, then rushed to the wardrobe and picked the favorite outfit: a yellow dress with little butterflies on it.
Defne’s mother braided the hair on both sides. As she put on the tiny hair clips, she smiled:
“You look wonderful today, Defne. We’ll celebrate together after you get your report card.”

When Defne went down to the kitchen, breakfast was already set by the father. There were eggs, olives, cheese, and Defne’s favorite—strawberry jam.
And a surprise: a glass of strawberry milk.
“Eat a good breakfast,” said the father. “Because we’ve got a surprise plan waiting.”

After receiving the report card, Defne got a big hug from the teacher, who said:
“Defne, you’ve made amazing progress this year. Your curious questions, your smile, and your kindness to your friends made me so happy.”
Defne looked down shyly, but the eyes were smiling.
“Thank you, teacher!”

At the school gate, Defne’s parents were waiting. The father had already packed the car trunk.
“Ready, little holiday explorer?” asked the father.
Defne looked surprised: “We’re going on a trip? Where to?”
Mother winked: “Surprise! You’ll see when we get there.”

On the way, Defne played games while watching out the window.
“Count the first red cars you see!” said the mother.
“One... two... three!” shouted Defne cheerfully.
Then the father turned on the car radio. They sang songs together and clapped along to the beat.

During the ride, the father pointed out animals.
“Look, Defne, those are sheep. Their wool is used to make warm sweaters.”
“What about those chickens?” asked Defne with curiosity.
“They lay eggs every morning—just like the ones we had for breakfast today.”
Defne nodded in wonder. “So they all work hard!”

A few hours later, they arrived at a small, lovely guesthouse by the sea.
Defne couldn’t believe it: deep blue water, soft white sand, and an endless sky.
“This is the most beautiful place I’ve ever seen!” shouted Defne.

While the mother unpacked, Defne quickly changed into a swimsuit. Holding the father’s hand, they ran to the sea.
The water was a little chilly at first, but soon Defne was laughing and splashing. Near the shore, they built a sandcastle together. They added tiny stones, flowers, and a seashell.
“This is our holiday castle!” said Defne proudly.

That evening, they took a walk along the beach at sunset.
The mother handed Defne a small trash bag.
“The sea is like our home,” she said. “It’s important we keep it clean.”
When Defne saw a plastic bottle on the ground, it was picked up right away.
“Sea creatures could get hurt by this, right, mom?”
“Yes, my dear. That’s why we must always be careful and caring,” replied the mother.

The next morning, Defne woke up early. There was morning exercise in the guesthouse garden.
Defne danced to warm up with the other kids, then they all had breakfast together.
They talked about where tomatoes and olives grow.
“I want to see an olive tree,” said Defne.
The guesthouse owner smiled: “Today, I’ll take you to a small olive grove.”

In the grove, Defne found a tiny turtle.
“Dad! Can I take it home?”
The father smiled:
“Animals are happier in their own homes—in nature. But we can give it water to help it cool down.”
Defne carried a little water in cupped hands and gently poured it on the turtle.
“Bye-bye, little friend,” said Defne, waving.

One day, there was a story hour in the guesthouse garden. Each child picked a book.
Defne took out a favorite one: Sophie in the Forest. Reading was always a joy.
Mother sat down nearby and whispered:
“Isn’t reading the best part of vacation?”
Defne nodded:
“Books let me explore new places even beyond the holiday!”

Defne made friends with other children, especially one named Lily.
They collected seashells, tossed stones into the water, and dreamed together.
“Let’s become mermaids when we grow up!” said Lily.
Defne laughed: “Okay, but I need to learn to swim first!”

One evening after dinner, the family set the table together.
Defne handed out napkins, the father set the glasses, and the mother brought the salad.
“Working together is so nice,” said Defne.
Mother smiled:
“Even during vacation, we must remember our responsibilities.”

Every day, Defne kept a journal.
In a little notebook, Defne drew pictures, listed animals seen, and wrote about games played with Lily.
“This will be my holiday journal,” said Defne. “I’ll keep it forever.”

On the last night, they sat on the beach under a sky full of stars.
The father pointed out a bright one:
“Look, Defne, the stars are with us, even on vacation.”
Defne smiled.
“I’ll keep what I learned on this holiday inside me, just like stars.”

When the holiday ended, Defne felt a little sad but happy.
While driving back, Defne held a postcard written for Lily.
“I’m going to mail it with mom,” said Defne.

Mother leaned in and whispered:
“A new school year means new adventures. Don’t forget to share the beautiful things you learned during this holiday with your friends.”

Defne winked:
“Okay, mom. I’ve put the holiday in my heart. Now it’s time for new discoveries!”
