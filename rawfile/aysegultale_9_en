Defne's New Neighbor
One morning, Defne sat by the window, watching the world outside. A truck had pulled up in front of the empty apartment of the building across the street. On the truck, bold letters spelled “TRANSPORT.”

Defne immediately scooped up Fluffy.
“Fluffy! Someone is moving in. Maybe a child our age will come. Perhaps they love books, maybe they’ll enjoy imaginative games!”

From the kitchen, her mother called out:
“Really? Maybe someone around your age lives there!”
Defne moved closer to the window.
“Look… Yes! A little child has gotten off. They’re wearing glasses and holding a plush dinosaur!”

But then her excitement wavered.
“What if they don’t like to talk? What if they don’t want to be friends?”
Her mother came over and gently stroked her hair.
“Some friendships begin with a smile. Courage is the first step.”

In the afternoon, Defne and her mother baked a plate of cookies.
“Cookies are the sweetest form of hello,” her mother said.
Defne carefully arranged the cookies and attached a note:
“Welcome! I’m Defne. I live upstairs. I hope you like cookies.”

They rang the doorbell excitedly. The woman who opened the door was warm and friendly, and standing beside her was a shy-looking child wearing glasses.
“I’m Defne. And this is Fluffy,” she said with a smile.
The child gave a small wave.
“I’m Ethan,” the child replied softly.
Her mother invited them inside.
“What a lovely surprise! Thank you so much for the cookies.”

Ethan was quiet. Defne sat down on a chair, holding Fluffy in her arms.
“Fluffy is always with me—whether I’m sleeping or playing…”
Suddenly, Ethan brightened up:
“My toy’s name is Dino!” he declared, showing his green plush dinosaur.

Defne felt a warm joy inside.
“So, he already has a friend!”

They chatted for a while. Defne mentioned her love for reading.
“I especially enjoy adventure stories. Like tales of lost maps and secret caves…”
Ethan nodded.
“I adore space books, too. One day, I want to be an astronaut.”

Their first meeting had gone wonderfully. But the next day, Ethan didn’t come out. Defne grew a bit worried.
“Mom… did I scare him off?”
Her mother smiled and replied,
“New neighbors sometimes need a little time. We must learn to be patient.”

On the third day, there was a knock on the door. When they opened it, there stood Ethan.
“I have a project,” he said earnestly.
“With my flashlight, I’m going to create a space pathway in the dark. Would you like to try it with me?”

Defne’s eyes sparkled as she nodded.
Together, they set up a small tent. Inside, they drew stars with a flashlight and listened to space-themed music.
“That star over there represents an imaginary planet beyond the Milky Way. Its name is DinoLand,” explained Ethan.
Defne added,
“And over here is Fluffyville, where all the plush friends live.”

When her mother saw them, she exclaimed,
“Your imaginations have turned even a blank wall into a sky full of stars!”

Later, they all went down to the apartment courtyard. While playing, an elderly neighbor woman approached.
“So, you must be the new neighbors… I planted these geraniums in the garden and named each one.”
Defne giggled,
“Maybe we can call one ‘Fluffy’?”
The neighbor smiled,
“Then I’ll name another one ‘Dino’!”

That evening, Defne wrote in her diary:
“Meeting someone new isn’t always easy, but waiting is part of friendship. Today, we embarked on a journey through space and even named some flowers. Ethan is now a true friend.”

They read books together and wrote letters. Then, a new idea emerged:
“A Neighborhood Club.”

They hung a small bulletin board in their apartment lobby with the heading “Neighbor Note of the Week.”

“Geraniums are in bloom in the garden!”
“Ethan and Defne are writing a new book together!”
“Miss Whiskers (the cat) introduced her new kittens!”

One day, Ethan was sad. Defne noticed and asked,
“What’s wrong?”
Ethan adjusted his glasses and said,
“I miss my old neighborhood friends a little. We used to go to the amusement park together. I won’t be able to go this year.”

Defne thought for a moment, then recalled something her mother used to do.
“Let’s make our own amusement park!”
At home, they fashioned a train out of pillows, bumper cars out of chairs, and a carousel from a spinning lamp.

In the evening, Ethan grinned,
“This place can even be more fun,” he said, laughing.

Finally, Ethan said,
“You’re the best thing here, Defne.”
Defne blushed slightly, but her heart leaped with joy.
“All I did was say hello. Everything else happened naturally.”

That night, Defne wrote in her diary:
“When someone new arrives, they can take up residence not only in your home but in your heart. Friendship sometimes begins with a plate of cookies and continues with an amusement park made of pillows.”

Then she hugged Fluffy and whispered,
“Tomorrow, let’s make a poster for the Neighborhood Club. Maybe more friends will come!”
