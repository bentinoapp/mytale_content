When Defne Got Sick
One morning, when Defne opened her eyes, she felt strange. There was a slight headache, her nose was congested, and her throat hurt a little. Her eyelids felt even heavier that morning.

She hugged Fluffy and whispered,
“I think... I feel a bit different today, Fluffy. It’s as if my body just needs some rest.”

Her mother gently opened the door and stepped in, saying,
“Good morning, sweet girl. How do you feel?”
Defne pulled her nose out from under the blanket and replied,
“Good morning... I think I’m a little sick.”
Her mother immediately came over and placed a hand on her forehead.
“Hmmm, you have a slight fever. We won’t go to school today; let’s rest well.”

Defne felt a bit disappointed. That day, her favorite school activity was story time at the library.
“But Mom... today was our library day. We were going to pick out new books.”
Her mother gently stroked her hair and said,
“Books will always be there, dear. Now it’s time to listen to what your body is telling you.”

Her mother brought her a soft pillow, a colorful blanket, and a cup of minty linden tea.
“This tea will soothe your throat. I sweetened it with love instead of sugar!”
Defne smiled and began to sip slowly.
“My nose feels like it’s stuffed with cotton,” she grumbled.

Her mother stayed by her side all day. Defne didn’t feel like watching TV. Instead, she sat with Fluffy and said,
“Today, you’re going to be the doctor, Fluffy. First, check my pulse, then write a prescription.”
Defne scribbled on a small piece of paper:
“Prescription for recovery: 1 big hug, 2 cups of hot tea, 3 stories, plenty of sleep.”

By noon, as her fever rose a little, her father came home early from work.
“My little star got sick and nobody told me!”
Defne smiled and said,
“It was a surprise illness...”

Her father had brought her a surprise book:
“A Day in Pillow Land”
In the book, a sick child rested in a land filled with pillows, dreaming, imagining, and gradually healing.
“I wish I could go to that land!” Defne said with her eyes closed, laughing.

In the late afternoon, the doctor arrived. She was a friendly woman with blue eyes.
“Hello, Defne. Today, I’m your health guide.”
Defne hesitated at first, but when she saw the toy stethoscope in the doctor’s bag, she became excited.
“Is that for me?”
“Yes, a gift for you. Now, let’s check with the real one,” she said as she listened to Defne’s heart and examined her throat.

“It’s just a minor throat infection. Rest, drink plenty of fluids, reduce screen time, and get lots of hugs!”
Defne asked in surprise,
“So, hugs are now a prescription?”
The doctor smiled,
“The strongest medicine is love!”

That night, with her fever subsiding, Defne slept more soundly. In her dream, she and Fluffy wandered through a land made of clouds of pillows—a place with soft teddy bears, talking blankets, and a river of minty tea.

The next day, Defne felt a little better. Her eyes were still heavy with sleep, but her throat no longer tickled as much.
Her mother had set up a small “recovery corner” in the living room—a cozy spot with a blanket, a hot water bottle, some favorite books, and Fluffy by her side.
“This is our Healing Nook,” her mother declared cheerfully.
Her father had left a little note by the tea, reading,
“Your laughter is missing from this tea—please add it in.”

In the afternoon, Defne drew a picture titled “The Planet of Sickness.” In this picture, everyone wore pajamas, and each person had a tiny angel on their head.
Then her mother offered a suggestion,
“How about writing a letter today? To yourself.”
Defne’s eyes widened,
“To myself?”
“Yes. Send some love to the Defne you see now, the sick one.”
So Defne wrote:
“Dear Sick Defne,
You need to slow down a bit. Make peace with your body and remember the strength within you. Rest, read, and be kind to yourself. Because you are amazing.”

Two days later, her fever finally subsided. Her nose was clear, and her face beamed with a smile.
Her mother sat Defne by the window,
“Look, the outside world is waiting for you—but first, the Defne inside must heal. Being patient is part of growing up.”

That day, her father surprised her by setting up a little “Home Library” in the living room—clearing out the bookshelf to create a special reading nook just for her. There were lights, cushions, and even a shelf labeled “Only Read While Healing.”
“Reading time just for recovering children!” her father announced.
Defne’s eyes filled with tears as she smiled,
“If being sick means this, then maybe it isn’t so bad after all.”

The next day, Defne returned to school. Her friends hugged her,
“Defneee! We missed you so much!”
Her teacher smiled and said,
“I saved a special book just for you.”
On her desk was a package with the title:
“Fluffy and Heart’s Warmth”
The book told the tale of a sick child who shared a healing adventure with a cuddly teddy bear.

Squinting her eyes, Defne looked at Fluffy and said,
“You’re not just a toy anymore—you’re an official hero!”

That night, Defne opened her diary and wrote:
“Being sick taught me to pause, listen, and pay attention to myself and my loved ones. Thanks to my family, my doctor, and Fluffy, not only did my throat heal, but my heart did too.”

Then she whispered into Fluffy’s ear,
“Tonight, in my dream we’ll visit Pillow Land again—but this time, I’ll treat you to tea!”
