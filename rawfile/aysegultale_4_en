Defne at the Picnic

On Saturday morning, Defne woke up to the wonderful smells coming from the kitchen. Mom was making pastries, and Dad was filling the thermos with tea. Defne jumped out of bed right away.

“We're going on a picnic today, right?”

Mom smiled.
“Yes, sweetheart, deep into the heart of nature! A place where birds sing and flowers dance...”

Defne ran excitedly to the room, bouncing with joy. The favorite backpack came out. Inside went sunscreen, a sketchbook, pastel crayons, and a stuffed bear named Cuddles.

“Cuddles loves nature too!” Defne said with a laugh.

Mom added a change of clothes, wet wipes, a hat, and mosquito spray to the bag.
“A few small preparations make a big difference outdoors,” Mom said. “We’ll learn about nature and have fun.”

While Dad was getting the car ready, Defne helped Mom.
“Can I pack the sandwiches?”
“Of course, but first let’s wash those hands properly,” Mom said.

Defne soaped up and washed carefully. Then together, they wrapped the sandwiches in colorful napkins and placed them in the basket. Homemade lemonade, sliced fruits, and cookies were added too.

On the way, Defne couldn’t sit still from excitement. Watching out the window, the trees and birds passed by.

“Look! A squirrel on that branch!”

Dad slowed down. The squirrel really was busy enjoying a snack.

When they arrived at the green picnic area, Defne couldn’t believe it. The grass was soft, the trees were towering. A gently flowing stream, butterflies fluttering among the flowers...

“It’s like a fairytale land!” Defne exclaimed.

They spread out blankets, opened the basket, set the thermoses. The sandwiches Defne helped make were eaten with delight.

“These sandwiches are amazing!” Dad said.
Defne smiled shyly.
“I added a little love too.”

After lunch, Defne took out the pastel crayons. Daisies, violets, poppies—everything around was drawn onto the pages.

“These flowers don’t just look colorful, they look happy too,” Defne said.
Mom sat nearby.
“Nature gives us beauty—and peace as well.”

Dad’s voice called out:
“Come on, let’s go by the stream!”

By the stream, Defne and Dad tried building a bridge from stones.
“Round stones balance better,” Dad said.
Defne carefully placed each one. Then a small piece of wood floated on the water.
“That’s Cuddles’ boat!” Defne laughed.

After a while, Defne lay down on the grass, gazing at the clouds.
“That one looks like a bear. And that one’s a giant banana!”
Dad lay down too.
“You’re painting the sky with your imagination.”

Nearby, some kids were playing ball. One of them called out:
“Wanna play with us?”

Defne was a bit shy but loved playing ball. In no time, running and kicking happily with the others.

Sometimes the ball went into the bushes or near the water.
“Let’s keep the ball safe from nature!” Defne warned.
The kids giggled but started playing more carefully.

While taking a break, Defne shared a thought:
“You know what? After playing in nature, we should thank it.”
“How?” one asked.
“By picking up trash, not picking flowers, and listening quietly,” said Defne.
The kids nodded. Everyone began gathering trash in small bags.

Under a tree, Defne found a snail.
“Snails are patient,” Mom said. “They go slow, but never lose their way.”
Defne watched for a long time.
“It seems confident. Small, but strong,” Defne said in awe.

A little later, Defne went birdwatching with binoculars. Dad pointed.
“Look, a sparrow on that branch! It’s carrying straw—it’s building a nest.”
Defne squinted and watched closely.
“A bird building its own home. That’s amazing!”

In the afternoon, everyone rested. Defne lay down on Mom’s lap, holding Cuddles close. Eyes slowly closed.

In a dream, butterflies carried Defne up into the sky. Flowers read poems, a race with a snail happened.

When the dream ended, eyes sparkled with emotion.
“Nature teaches me how to dream,” Defne whispered.

As the evening came and the sun began to set, it was time to pack up. Defne looked a little sad.

“I don’t want to leave,” said Defne.
Dad smiled.
“Every beautiful day makes room for another. We’ll come again next week.”
Defne lit up.
“Then I’ll bring friends from school too. Let’s explore nature together.”

Back home, Defne opened the journal.

“Today I talked with nature. The wind whispered to me, the flowers smiled. The snail taught me patience, the birds taught me hard work. Nature is like a teacher. I played, laughed, and learned. I’ll never forget this day.”

In big letters, wrote:
“A picnic is not just about food—it’s about becoming friends with nature.”

Then turned to Cuddles and whispered:
“Next time, we’ll count the stars in the sky. Be ready!”

And that night, filled with memories from the heart of nature, Defne fell into a deep, peaceful sleep.
