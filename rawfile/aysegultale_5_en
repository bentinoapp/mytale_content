Defne’s Colorful Dream

One evening, while writing in a diary, Defne looked out the window. The sky had darkened, and stars sparkled above. A gentle knock, and a familiar voice came from the door—
“It's bedtime, dear Defne.”
Defne glanced up from the diary.
“Today felt so ordinary. I wish I could go on adventures even in dreams.”
A warm smile appeared as someone entered and gently stroked Defne’s hair.
“Dreams can be more colorful than you imagine. Close your eyes—see with your heart.”

Defne turned off the lamp, hugged Minnoş tightly, and snuggled into a blanket.
“Minnoş, we must dream something truly beautiful tonight, okay?” whispered softly.
And the moment eyes were closed, the magical door to dreams slowly opened…

Suddenly, Defne found themself rising into the sky. Soft cotton clouds floated below, and vivid rainbows arched above. In the middle of it all was a tiny flying boat. At the helm stood a charming owl.
“Welcome, Defne! I am Guide Owl. You’ve entered the Realm of Dreams!”
Defne’s eyes widened in amazement.
“I really am dreaming! And with a talking owl!”
The owl chuckled.
“This is the land of imagination. Here, nothing is impossible!”

As the boat landed in the dream realm, the first stop was the Forest of Colors. The leaves on the trees were red, purple, blue, and orange. Shapes danced on their trunks—hearts, stars, spirals…
Defne reached out to touch a tree. It whispered:
“Hello, Defne. I’m the Wishing Tree. Make a wish, and I’ll show you.”
Defne closed their eyes and wished quietly:
“I want to see the color of happiness.”
Instantly, the tree's leaves turned golden yellow and glowed with warmth.

The owl swooped down:
“Your first color: Happiness Yellow!”
Defne smiled.
“Do colors really have feelings?”
With a flap of wings, the owl replied:
“In dreams, everything is possible. Ready to find the color of courage?”

Next stop: the Cave of Courage. It was dark inside, but glowing stones lit up the walls. Defne stepped forward with careful, hesitant steps.
Suddenly, Minnoş slipped from the arms.
“Minnoş! Where are you?” called out.
At that moment, a small glowing orb appeared from the cave wall, lighting the path ahead.
“Courage begins right here,” whispered the light.
Defne took a deep breath, narrowed their eyes, and walked forward.
At the end of the cave stood a blue waterfall. Its water, dark as night, sang in a soft voice.

The owl appeared again.
“This is Courage Blue. From darkness, light is born.”

Exiting the cave, Defne stepped into a meadow. In its center stood a giant canvas with bright paints all around.
A paintbrush rose on its own and began to speak:
“Here, you’ll paint your feelings. Show your dream’s journey.”
Defne began with yellow: painting happiness.
Then came blue: brushing in courage.
Suddenly, another color called from within—green.
“This feels like peace,” said softly.
The owl nodded:
“Nature, friendship, and balance: Peaceful Green.”

Defne rolled across the grass and gazed at the sky as a shooting star streaked above.
It spoke!
“Defne, every color reflects an emotion. Which one do you carry most in the real world?”
Defne thought for a moment.
“Maybe red. Because love and excitement always make my heart dance.”
The star glowed brighter.
“A heart full of love always shines.”

As sunset approached, the owl handed over a book. On the cover were the words:
“The Diary of Colorful Dreams”
“You can draw a piece of each night’s dream here,” said the owl.
“That way, your dreams will stay with you, even after you wake.”

A soft breeze rose. A distant voice echoed—
“Defne... Defne, it’s time to wake up…”
The owl spoke one last time:
“Don’t forget your colors as you return. The world inside you may be more magical than the one outside.”

Defne opened their eyes. Minnoş was still in their arms. With a yawn and a smile, whispered:
“What a beautiful dream…”

There was something in the pocket of the pajamas. A tiny card.
Courage Blue remembers you.
Defne smiled in wonder.

Immediately, the diary on the desk was opened and a new entry began:
“Tonight, I visited the Forest of Colors. Trees whispered. Owls guided the way. I walked through my fears, painted love, and smelled peace. I’ve learned colors speak through feelings. Now I am a colorful Defne too.”

Then, picked up a yellow pencil and drew a bright sun next to the heart.

Turning to Minnoş, whispered with a grin:
“I wonder which color we’ll visit tonight. But first... let’s get some sleep.”
