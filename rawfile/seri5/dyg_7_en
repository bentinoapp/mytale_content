Defne and the Maze of Astonishment

In the Land of Emotions, time did not flow at the same pace every day. Some mornings, daylight spread slowly, and even the wind yawned in its own time. Other mornings, though, everything began at once: birds sang as if the night had never existed, clouds raced by, and colors seemed brighter.
On that morning, everything started suddenly.
And Defne understood nothing.

The moment she opened her window, the sky was painted yellow. Leaves fell upward toward the heavens instead of downward to the ground. Flowers closed as if they bloomed at night, and the earth was covered not by rain from above but by mist rising from below.

Everything felt familiar and yet utterly strange.

A familiar emotion stirred within Defne.
A flutter…
A state of “trying to make sense”…
Astonishment.

This feeling did not shout like anger or fear, nor did it weep like sorrow, nor did it laugh like joy. Yet it settled in the heart’s center, nudged the mind, and froze her steps.

That morning, Defne awoke astonished.
But instead of fleeing, she chose to walk toward the source of that feeling.

Deep in the Land of Emotions lay a hidden place on no map but sensed by everyone: the Maze of Astonishment.

Reaching it required no compass heading of north or west or east.
It came only by:
taking a step without choosing a direction,
moving forward without knowing where you were going.

Defne began to walk.
But this was no ordinary journey.
With each step, her surroundings shifted.
One moment a forest, the next a street, then a desert, then a classroom…
None of it remained constant.

Then suddenly… a door appeared. One word was written above it:

“Are you ready?”

Defne drew a deep breath and pushed the door open.
The maze began.

The first section was a corridor of mirrors.
Defne saw dozens of reflections as she walked.
Each one was different.
In one, she was small; in another, elderly.
In one mirror, sorrowful; in another, merry.
In one, she smiled; in another, she shouted.

“Which one am I?” she asked herself.
No answer came.

For astonishment grows not with answers but with questions.

Defne walked among the mirrors. At first she panicked, for she could not find her true reflection.
But then she thought:
“Could all of these be me?”

A door opened.

The second section was a room of echoes.
Voices bounced from wall to wall, yet no source could be seen.

“Why have you come?”
“There is no way out here.”
“Everything is unlike what you know.”
“What you believe may not be true.”

Words pricked her mind like thorns.
Yet Defne began to write down every voice.
Her notebook filled with notes:
“Perhaps I am not always right.”
“What I think I know might just be habit.”
“What I don’t understand is not frightening, but new.”

In that moment, the voices softened.
Another door opened.

The third section was the room of backward walkers.
Every creature there walked backward.
To move forward, they fixed their gaze on what lay ahead, not behind.
At first Defne laughed at the sight.
Then she felt astonished.
Finally… she decided to try.

She walked backward slowly.
Without falling.
Yet without feeling as if she were moving…

After a while, she came to a plaque in the center of the room:

“Sometimes, to understand something, you must step backward.
Progress does not always mean moving forward.”

Defne stopped. She sat down and closed her eyes.
A cool clarity filled her.
Astonishment was no longer a question, but a friend.

The fourth section was a place built of walls of meaninglessness.
On the walls were half-finished phrases:

“If only… but then…”
“If nothing has a reason…”
“Not knowing… is knowing in itself…”

Defne spent hours before those walls.
At first she tried to make sense.
Then to solve them…
But nothing became clear.

And suddenly she realized:
“Not everything must have meaning. But that doesn’t mean it’s meaningless.”

She smiled.
For the first time, she made peace with astonishment.
And another door opened.

The final section was entirely white.
No walls, no doors…
No writing, no sounds…

Only a blank white void.
Defne began to walk, but the landscape did not shift.
Did time pass?
Or had everything stopped?

Then a voice rose within her:
“I don’t know.”

Upon speaking those words, it felt as if a chain had been unlocked.
In that void appeared a notebook.
Inside, one sentence was written:

“Astonishment is the mind’s first step toward growth.
Those who greet the unknown not with fear but with wonder…
Learn by surprising themselves.”

Defne closed the notebook.
She stood quietly for a moment.
Then the maze vanished.

She found herself on a hill in the Land of Emotions. The sun was setting. This sky felt familiar. The breeze was cool. The trees were still.

But Defne was not the same.

Now she could pause before trying to understand something.
Faced with an event, she could say “Hmm…” instead of “Why?”
She had learned to endure unanswered questions.
And perhaps most importantly, she had embraced staying astonished.

For she now knew:

“Growth is sometimes not about understanding the unknown,
but carrying it with you even when you don’t understand.”
