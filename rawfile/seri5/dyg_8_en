Defne and the Search for the Star of Longing

In the quietest hour of the night, when the sky wore its deepest shade of black, Defne was awake. Sitting up in bed, head turned toward the window, Defne saw darkness everywhere. Even the moon was absent. Yet far away something glimmered—
a light,
still yet alive,
a lone star that shone like a tiny heartbeat in the center of the heavens.

While gazing at the star, Defne felt a familiar knot in the throat. An emptiness spread from within—a feeling that was neither pure pain nor pure joy, neither wholly past nor fully present. It was longing, an unnamed “if only” settling into one corner of the heart.

That night Defne decided:
“The star is there. I must find it, because longing is not only to feel—it is to seek.”

Before dawn, the journey began.
There was no road for such a journey,
no map, no compass, no set direction,
for longing follows no charted route;
it can be walked only by feeling.

With the first step, the sky was still dark, yet the star remained—
distant, unmoving, as though calling.

The First Stop – The Abandoned House
The path led to an old house whose walls were moss‑covered, windows shattered, roof half‑collapsed. Inside, however, everything lay where it once had:
a worn toy,
a half‑filled notebook,
height marks scratched upon a wall,
a chair bearing a pillow whose owner’s name was long forgotten.

Passing through the objects, Defne’s chest tightened. A memory flickered:
a voice,
a laugh,
a hand now absent.

A whisper rose from within: “If only…”

At that moment a door appeared upon the wall, glowing words above it:

“Longing is the mark time leaves.
The more it is recalled, the larger it grows;
the more it is buried, the heavier it becomes.”
Defne stepped through the doorway.

The Second Stop – The Empty Station
Next came a vacant station.
No train, no traveler.
Yet on a bench sat a bag containing
a map with no route,
a ticket without a date,
and a note: “I will return.”

Examining the bag, Defne’s heart stirred—like a promise given yet unkept, a sentence left unfinished.

Longing belongs not only to what is lost, but also to what was never completed. Defne understood then: “Some waiting never ends.”

At the end of the silent rails a light appeared, rising like a staircase into the sky. Defne continued.

The Third Stop – The Inverted Forest
A dreamlike forest emerged where trees grew downward into the earth while roots climbed toward the clouds. On every trunk a name was carved—familiar names of those once cherished, now gone.

Fingers brushed a tree’s bark; warmth pulsed—deep, known, as intense as a gaze, an embrace, a farewell. A tear fell, mingling with the soil. The star brightened.

The Final Stop – The Plain of Emptiness
At last lay a flat, unlit plain. Nothing here—no sound, color, or form—only emptiness. Yet Defne knew this was longing itself, for longing is sometimes the very absence that gnaws like a presence.

Defne sat upon the ground, closed eyes, and thought of the star—of an unnamed memory perhaps never lived, of an unfinished song, of an unsaid “I miss you.”

Opening eyes, Defne found the star close, now descended to stand just ahead—small, simple, yet radiant.

Then a voice—neither outside nor inside—rose like a feeling:

“Longing is not what is lost,
but the echo of what has been lived.
Do not suppress it.
Speak with it.
Carry it.
For longing is the deepest form of remembrance.”
Defne cupped the star in both hands. It was warm but did not burn—small enough to rest in the very center of the heart.

And in that moment Defne understood:

“Longing does not fade;
we learn to live alongside it.”

Returning Home
The night remained dark on the way back, yet a light now glowed within Defne’s heart—pulsing with the same warmth as the star, the light known to all who carry longing without smothering it.

From that day on, whenever a hollow feeling returned, whenever the bridge of the nose tingled with tears, whenever an old smile was sought, Defne touched the star within.

Because now it was clear:

“Longing is not the act of losing…
it is the ability to remember.”
