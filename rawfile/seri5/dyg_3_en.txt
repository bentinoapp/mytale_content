Defne and Getting Lost in the Forest of Anger

The morning sun had not yet crested the hills. The sky hung in a gray in-between of night and day. Defne stood at the entrance of one of the most tangled and most avoided regions of the Land of Emotions: the Forest of Anger. The trees were so dense, the branches so interwoven, that the forest’s interior could not be seen from outside. Inside lay a secret, a scream, a whirlwind of emotion.

Until now, no one had dared venture deep into that forest. Those who tried returned early, and some lost their way entirely. The Forest of Anger challenged travelers not only physically but emotionally. For anyone who entered would face their own darkest, most suppressed rage.

From previous journeys, Defne knew one thing clearly:
True happiness comes only when all emotions are acknowledged.

And anger… was far stronger and deeper than most.

At the forest’s edge hung a small wooden sign, its surface cracked and the words deeply carved:

“Anyone who enters will hear their own voice echo back.”

Defne took a steadying breath, planted both feet firmly, and stepped forward.

No sooner had they entered than the air shifted. The wind didn’t rustle—it growled. Trees struck each other, branches creaked. No birds sang; the silence felt heavy, as if an unseen weight pressed against Defne’s chest.

The first few steps passed uneventfully. But as they ventured deeper…
The ground trembled beneath their feet.

Suddenly a shadow burst from the trees. It was huge—black and crimson, with eyes burning like coals. It had no mouth, but its voice thundered:
“WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?”
“THIS IS NOT YOUR PLACE!”

Defne staggered, but did not flee.
“I want to know you,” they replied.
“Because I have a voice inside me like yours. Sometimes it shouts; sometimes it falls silent—but it never truly leaves.”

The shadow paused.
Then the forest trembled with something like laughter.
“Very well. Know me then. But beware… do not lose yourself.”

The path narrowed. Between the trees, the trail almost vanished. Defne pressed on, each step stirring a memory:

A moment when trust was shattered…
A day of injustice…
Words swallowed when no one would listen…
A swelling knot born of every silence…

Defne’s eyes filled with tears.
“I… sometimes I get so angry I barely recognize myself,” they whispered.

At that confession, a light appeared in the forest—like a glowing stone. Each admission loosened a tangle inside, brightening the path deeper into the woods.

But then… a scream rang out.

Not an echo, but a real scream—racked with pain, broken, repressed.

Defne ran. Branches clawed at their arms as they raced past. They fell, sank into mud—but rose again. At the source of the sound, they found a small child.

The child… looked just like Defne. Same eyes, same face…
But their expression was different.
This child was furious—fists clenched, brow furrowed, fire flowing instead of tears.

“YOU NEVER LOOKED AT ME!” the child cried.
“YOU IGNORED ME! YOU KEPT SILENCING ME!”

Defne sank to their knees and looked into the child’s eyes.
“I’m sorry,” they said.
“I was afraid of my own anger. I thought if I buried it, it would vanish. But instead you grew… and ended up all alone.”

The child fell silent. Their fists relaxed. Then they approached and took Defne’s hand.
In that moment… the child’s form dissolved into light.
Like a spark, it flowed into Defne’s heart.

The forest shifted.
Branches loosened; light filtered through the leaves once more. Birds returned. The earth softened. And Defne emerged into a clearing.

At its center lay a great stone, its inscription glowing:

“Anger is poison when suppressed, power when faced. Do not deny it—transform it.”

Defne knelt before the stone, feeling warmth spread through their chest.
Now their anger was no threat but a warning.
A guidepost.
A boundary.
A voice.

For the first time, they thanked the anger within.

As Defne walked out of the forest, they glanced back.
It was not a place of darkness.
Only of reflection.

And they finally understood:
Every shadow, once seen, can turn to light.
