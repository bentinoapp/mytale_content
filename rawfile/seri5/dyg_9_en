Defne and the Seeds of Courage

This morning in the Land of Emotions, the breeze blew differently—neither cool nor warm, neither soft nor harsh… yet it carried meaning. A breeze can be a harbinger. That dawn, it whispered quietly:
“Now the time has come.”

The moment Defne awoke, she heard it. A flutter in her heart, a trembling yet patient call in her chest. Traces of past journeys still lingered in her mind. But this time it was different.
This time… it was time to move.

That very morning, in the northeast of the Land of Emotions, a nearly forgotten region began to gleam on the maps once more: the Garden of Courage.

Long ago, this garden had been abandoned—some said it had never even existed. Yet in those lands, courage used to grow. Yes—you heard correctly:
courage was a seed.
Planted in the soil, tended with care, watered to flourish.
Over time, however, people stopped seeking the seed and waited for courage to arrive ready-made. And so the garden was forgotten.

Until today.

Defne set out empty‑handed. No lantern, no map, no notebook… only a small pouch in her pocket, containing a few dried seeds. She couldn’t recall where they came from—only that someone had given them to her once, saying, “Someday you will need these.” Today must be that day.

The road was long.
At first through silent woods—trees stepping aside to make way.
Then over rocky slopes—feet slipping, knees scrapped.
Still, Defne did not stop.

Because this time there was no turning back.
For courage is sometimes simply choosing to go on.

After much walking, a clearing opened. But silence reigned. The earth lay cracked and parched. No flower, no insect… as if no life remained.

Yet Defne knew:
What cannot be seen is not nonexistent.
Something waited beneath the soil.

She opened her pouch, took a few seeds into her palm, and bent to dig with her hands.

As she dug the first hole, a thought rose:
“What if I fail?”
She paused, drew a steady breath, and placed a seed in the earth.
“I plant alongside that fear,” she whispered.
“For courage is not the absence of fear, but action in its presence.”

When she sowed the second seed another doubt spoke:
“What if no one appreciates it?”
This time she planted with resolve:
“Courage sometimes means risking misunderstanding.”

For the third seed came the question:
“What if I stand alone?”
And the answer:
“To walk on alone is the root of courage.”

When the last seed lay buried, Defne’s hands were caked in soil—but her heart felt light. All those inner voices, every worry, had blended into the earth.

She searched for water to nourish the seeds—found none except a few tears glistening on her cheeks: warm, salty, compassionate.

Defne did not hide them. She cupped her tears, then let them fall on the soil.

And in that moment… something stirred.

The ground quivered. A tiny sprout broke through—delicate, green, like newborn hope.

Defne could scarcely believe her eyes. With just a few tears and a courageous step forward, the earth awakened. Soon a second shoot appeared. A third, a fourth, a fifth… Soon the entire clearing quivered with life.

Through the cracks in the dry ground, renewal seeped in. The seeds grew in hushed determination. Each sprout bore its own hue—some red, some purple, some yellow—yet all drew strength from the same deep root: courage.

Defne stood in the heart of the garden, hands at her sides, eyes wide. It was not a victory—it was a beginning. For in that instant she understood:
Courage is not an end, but a sprouting.
Not a battle, but a growth.
Not a shout, but a resolute whisper.

From a corner of the garden, a figure approached—neither wholly human nor purely creature, a presence felt more than seen.

It came to stand before Defne and offered her a handful of soil.

Within it lay a single seed—unlike the others. It gleamed, it quivered, it pulsed with its own rhythm, as if it had a heartbeat.

The being spoke:
“This is the seed of self‑courage. The others were for the world; this is for you. Wherever you plant it, there you will meet courage anew.”

Defne took the seed in both hands, pressed it to her heart, and felt an inner warmth—gentle yet strong, calm yet profound.

A breeze stirred through the garden, unlike any before. It rose from the soil itself: the breath of courage, caressing each sprout, whispering, “I am here.”

As Defne walked among the young plants, every step left a trace, and at each footfall a new flower burst forth—proving that simply being was enough.

For now she knew:
Courage is less about triumph and more about stepping into the soil.
As much about silence as about speech.
About walking while weeping, and trying while trembling.

When at last she prepared to return, the garden had transformed. No longer a desert, but a lush oasis. The sprouts had become blooms of emotion:
One flower for “the first step,”
another for “confession,”
another for “forgiveness,”
and yet another for “beginning again.”

Defne bowed respectfully before each one.

As the journey ended, she sat upon a small hill, gazing not at the horizon but at the tiny seed in her hand. In the quiet that matched her heart’s new rhythm, she whispered:

“I understand now.
Courage is sometimes lifting your head in silence,
sometimes closing your eyes to listen to your heart,
loving yourself when you know so little,
and moving forward in spite of fear.”

That night the stars shone brighter, for one more seed of courage had sprouted. Another heart had chosen its own path.
