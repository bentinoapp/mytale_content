Defne and Waiting on the Isle of Patience

The wind blew softly that morning. The sky was clear of clouds, yet stretched overhead in an unusually muted hue. To the east of the Land of Emotions lay a place rarely visited, marked on maps by only a thin line: the Isle of Patience.

This island existed in legend. Some claimed it never appeared at all. Others believed only those who could halt time could find it. To reach the isle, one needed to find a raft in the Bay of Stillness, set out at first light, and drift for hours without a breath of wind.

Defne had been waiting for days. Hoping for a change in the wind’s direction, a calm in the waves, any sign from the sky saying “go.” But nothing came. This was different from earlier journeys. On this voyage, nothing could be done but wait.

Then one morning… at an entirely unexpected moment… the rope securing the raft at the shore came undone.
No hand had released it.
Yet the raft seemed to call: “The time has come.”

Defne rose without hesitation and stepped aboard the raft.
There was no wind. No sail. Only the sea, the sky, and the act of waiting.

The raft drifted for hours over glassy water. No oar, no rudder… yet it moved forward. At times, the sound of waves whispered; at times, silence prevailed. Defne looked first at the sky, then at the sea, then into their own heart.

Minutes passed. Perhaps hours…

Then a question formed in Defne’s mind:
“Can choosing to do nothing be a choice too?”

At that very moment, the sky parted slightly. A shaft of light appeared in the distance.
There it was: the Isle of Patience.

From afar the isle looked small, but as it neared, it grew in scale.
And strangely… it was motionless.
Trees stood silent, their leaves unmoving.
Birds perched without flight.
Waters lay still without current.

As if everything had frozen within a single instant.

The raft glided gently to the shore. When Defne placed bare feet on the sand, an unexpected sensation arose. Neither excitement nor fear… only stillness.
Yet this stillness was not dull, but deeply peaceful.
As if the world itself whispered, “Do not hurry.”

Defne walked inland. Passing between the trees, a voice seemed to murmur in their ear:

“Are you ready to learn how to grow without moving?”

At the island’s center lay a perfect stone circle. In its middle stood a wooden bench and beside it, a small table. On the table rested an hourglass that had not been flipped. Its sands were not meant to flow.
A note was attached to the hourglass:

“There is no time here. Only your own time exists.”

Defne sat down and simply gazed around. The birds did not flit from branch to branch; they remained still. The wind did not stir the leaves. Everything was at rest.
Only Defne’s thoughts moved.

An hour passed, or perhaps a full day.
Time’s measure may never have been reached.
Yet stirrings began within Defne’s inner world.

First came impatience—a desire to rise, to move, to do something.
Then Defne asked:
“What am I rushing toward?”
“Do I seek a destination, or am I fleeing my own stillness?”

A deep breath followed. Hands rested on knees. Eyes closed.
And for the first time… there was no desire to act.
Just being was enough.

When eyes opened, a single grain of sand had fallen in the hourglass.
Yet that solitary grain echoed across the island as thunder.
As if it symbolized the entire act of waiting.

Then a figure emerged: a presence clad in white, face shrouded in mist, voice soft and kind.
The figure approached but did not sit or speak.
It simply handed Defne a scroll.

On it was written:

“Patience is not a race against time but a friendship with time.
Sometimes doing nothing is the beginning of the greatest inner transformation.
Those who are patient trust the process, not just the outcome.”

As Defne read the words, the figure dissolved into the mist.
But its departure felt complete, not sorrowful.
The message had been delivered.

Leaving the isle, everything seemed unchanged. Trees stood fixed, birds motionless, the sea calm.
Yet Defne was changed.
Now, waiting was known to be possible.

Waiting is not emptiness but maturity…
Patience is not passivity but trust…

And sometimes, accomplishing nothing is itself an answer.

The raft set course on its own. As it carried Defne home, the sky seemed to smile.
The horizon grew clear.
And Defne thought:

“Sometimes one must watch a tree grow.
Even if its roots remain unseen, trust that they are reaching deep…”
