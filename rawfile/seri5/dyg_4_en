Defne and Dancing with the Clouds of Sorrow

The morning sky was painted in shades of gray. There was no wind, but the air felt heavy. In the Land of Emotions, everyone chose to stay indoors. Those who ventured outside walked with bowed heads, never lifting their gaze. The birds were silent, and even the leaves on the trees seemed to stir less.

Defne stood before the window, looking up at the thick clouds overhead. These were no ordinary rain clouds. Deep navy and muted purple swirled together, forming a still shadow across the sky. These clouds carried something:
Sorrow.

These Sorrow Clouds had appeared sporadically across the Land of Emotions, but today they seemed determined to stay. And once again, Defne heard that familiar inner voice:
“You must go.”

They made no preparations. No food, no lantern, no books—only a handkerchief slipped into a pocket. They did not know why, but something inside urged that it would be needed.

The Sorrow Clouds always gathered on the northwest border of the Land of Emotions. To reach them, one had to pass through rocky valleys, silent fields, and lone hills. Along the way, no living creature appeared, for this was territory chosen by those seeking solitude.

Defne began to walk.

At first, nothing changed. The earth was damp, but not muddy. The wind was faint, yet its presence felt oppressive. A few hours later, the sky darkened further. The clouds hovered even closer, their shadow falling across the path.

Then… the rain began. But it was not ordinary rain.

Each drop seemed laden with a memory.
When the first drop fell, Defne remembered a voice:
“Why don’t you understand me?”
At the second drop, a scene welled before their eyes:
A day spent alone, unnoticed and uncalled for…

The rain fell from the sky, not from Defne’s eyes, but each drop struck the heart.

Defne kept walking. Their feet grew heavy, vision blurred.
“I’m sorry,” they whispered,
“I’ve hidden this feeling for so long, trying to appear strong. But I have broken more times than I’ve admitted.”

At that moment, the rain fell harder. The sky wept. And Defne realized for the first time:
This was not just a feeling—it was a form of expression.

When they reached a small hill, they found a narrow path descending in mist. They stepped quietly along it. With each step, the air grew cooler, more intense.

And there…
A figure emerged from the fog.

Draped in a white cloak, the figure’s face was hidden. Its presence carried a gentle sadness. It held a violin—and began to play.

The music spoke directly to the heart, a wordless language of sorrow.
At the first note, Defne closed their eyes.
At the second, their throat tightened.
By the third… tears slipped down their cheeks.

The figure said nothing, yet its song seemed to say:
“Sorrow wants to be heard. When it’s buried, it grows; when it’s given voice, it eases.”

Defne took out the handkerchief and wiped away the tears. But this time not in shame—
in acceptance.

As the fog lifted, the violinist vanished, and a path opened in its place. The trail led to a clearing, at its center a large pond.

The surface lay mirror‑like. Yet it reflected more than images; it revealed unspoken words from the past.

Defne approached and heard faint whispers:

“When I was alone, I blamed the darkness inside me.”  
“When no one stood by me, I doubted my worth.”  
“All I ever wanted was a voice, a touch, understanding.”

Those words fell into the pond not as tears, but as healing.
And the pond… began to glow.

In its center rose a small island. Gentle and round, its sole tree stood leafless, dripping with water like tears.

But as Defne drew nearer, they saw glowing text carved into the bark:

“Sorrow does not slow you—it deepens you. Each tear plants a seed in the garden of your heart.”

Defne touched the tree. And at that moment… leaves sprouted across its branches. Each leaf was a different hue—some pale blue, some gray‑green, some in shades of purple. Yet together they formed a whole.

The rain ceased. The sky remained gray, but no longer oppressive.
A gentle breeze stirred; birdsong returned.

Defne sat beneath the tree.
And said to themselves:
“Sorrow is not a curse. Unspoken sorrow weighs you down. But sorrow that is spoken… sometimes becomes a song, a story.”

From that moment on, Defne felt more complete.
To be complete was neither to be joyful nor to appear strong.
Completeness… came from recognizing all feelings, from hiding none.

The paths back home, damp from the rain, no longer slithered treacherously but gleamed with life.
As if the earth had wiped away its own tears and lightened.

Defne walked onward,
With slow, deep, yet determined steps…

For now they knew:
Some dances can only be learned in the rain.
