Defne and the Summit of Fear Mountain

At the stillest hour of dawn, before the sky had fully said farewell to night, Defne sat by her window and fixed her gaze on the distant peak. That was the highest point in the Land of Emotions—shrouded in mist, capped with snow, both mysterious and a little frightening. It was called Fear Mountain.

Whenever its name was spoken, people fell silent and looked away. No one dared approach it, for legend held that at the summit lived the “Master of Fears.” Whoever climbed up would have their deepest dread drawn out, the shadow they barely dared acknowledge laid bare.

Yet one morning Defne made an unexpected decision. “I must climb that mountain,” she told herself.

No one had urged her on—she simply felt a calling, not a voice but a tug deep in her heart, a curious, urgent need. She packed a few slices of bread, a piece of fruit, and the little lantern she loved most into her backpack, then tucked in her journal. This journey would be no ordinary trek on a map but an inner voyage to record every step.

“I’m ready,” she whispered—and set off.

Along the path everything was hushed. Even the birds seemed to have paused their singing. When Defne reached the mountain’s base, a wall of mist greeted her like a silent welcome. A chill ran through her bones as she passed into the cloud, but she pressed on. After all, this was Fear Mountain—warmth belonged to the Mountain Rose Peak.

Beyond the first incline she came upon a narrow pass. Suddenly, a voice fluttered through the air, as if carried on the wind: “Turn back.”

Defne paused. The warning didn’t come from outside but from within, as though a part of her heart pleaded for her to abandon this quest. Still, she kept walking.

The wind grew stronger and the sky darkened. Trees leaned toward her as if to block her way with their branches. Yet Defne’s steps did not falter. Once she looked back, but the world behind her had already vanished into the mist—there was no path home, even if she’d wanted to return.

“Fear is natural,” a whisper echoed in her mind, “but to bow to fear is another matter.”

By the time she reached the second slope, Defne was weary. Her breath came in ragged gasps and her legs ached. Then she spotted a stone carving at the edge of the trail: a shadowy figure.

The statue stood headless, its arms unnaturally long, its feet lifted as though it hovered. Across its chest were etched words:

“I am the Gatekeeper of Fears. To pass, you must confess your fear.”

Defne’s heart pounded. She closed her eyes and asked herself, “What am I truly afraid of?”

For a moment she thought of heights, of getting lost, of darkness—but none of those were her true terror. Deeper down lay something else.

She spoke aloud: “I’m afraid of being all alone.”

In that instant the stone figure pulsed with light and then crumbled into dust, clearing the path ahead.

The third stretch was even harder. The trail narrowed and the soil underfoot turned loose. Several times she nearly slipped. When she brushed against a bramble, its thorns cut her palm. As the warm trickle of blood ran down her fingers, she thought, “Fears leave marks not only on our minds but on our bodies too.”

Still, she pressed onward.

Only a few hundred steps remained before the summit. The air thinned, each breath more labored, each footfall heavier. But Defne knew now that turning back would be far harder than going on—she refused to abandon either the path or her courage.

At last… she reached the summit.

There was no fearsome creature, no raging storm—only a mirror.

It rested atop a lone boulder, round and ancient, as though holding millennia of wisdom within its frame. Defne approached and peered into its glass.

She saw herself—not just as she was in that moment, but layered with memories of childhood, dreams, fears, and hopes. The true Master of Fears, she realized, lived within her own reflection.

Suddenly the mirror shone brightly, and Defne was blinded by light. In the hush that followed, a voice spoke from the darkness: “When you face your fears, you see that they no longer control you. You are free.”

When her sight returned, Defne found herself standing at the foot of the mountain. Had she descended? Or never truly climbed at all? She couldn’t say—but she felt something in her pocket.

A fragment of the mirror. At first it looked like an ordinary chipped stone, but looking closely she saw her own face—and the courage shining in her eyes.

From that day on, whenever Defne felt afraid, she would touch that little shard in her pocket and remember: fears dissolve when you walk straight through them.
