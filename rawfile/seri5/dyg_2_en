Defne and the Secret of the River of Happiness

One day, Defne sat on the bank of a long, winding river that sparkled in the southern reaches of the Land of Emotions. On old maps it was labeled the River of Happiness. Its waters ran clear and smooth, gleaming brightly under the sun, or stretching like a silver ribbon in the moonlight.

Yet no one knew where this river began.

Nobody—neither ancient water‑masters nor wandering scholars—had ever seen its source. People simply watched it from the shore, for it was easy to feel happiness there. But the river’s true secret lay hidden at its origin.

That morning, as Defne gazed at the flowing water, they made a decision.
“I must find its source,” they said.
“Because I want not only to experience happiness but to understand it.”

Into their pack they placed only one item: an empty notebook with a single word embossed on its cover:
“Happiness.”

Thus began their journey.

Defne set off northward along the riverbank. The path was flat, the air cool, the river quiet; grass brushed their feet, and birds flitted through the bushes. Everything felt right.

On the first day they passed a village where everyone seemed to be smiling. People sat on doorsteps, children played, elders nodded—all with the same expression: happiness.

But Defne sensed something odd. These smiles felt hollow. Eyes never sparkled, and everyone repeated the same phrases.

An old villager called out, “If you seek happiness, stay here. We are happy.”

Defne shook their head and kept walking.
“Happiness shouldn’t be a mask,” they thought.
“If your eyes don’t smile, what good is the grin on your lips?”

On the second day, the river’s murmur grew musical, a gentle song of ripples over stones. Midway across a small raft drifting on the water, a troupe danced and played instruments in colorful costumes.

They waved and called, “Join us! Music is happiness itself.”

Defne hesitated. The melody looped endlessly without tiring them, but the joy felt forced.
“Is happiness simply endless revelry?” they wondered.
“Must one hear the same tune again and again? Doesn’t true happiness include variety?”

They left the raft behind and pressed on.

On the third day the river’s voice softened to a whisper. Defne entered a quiet forest where the water ran lower. Beneath the shade, everything felt simpler, more calm.

Under an ancient tree sat someone reading a blank book, as if the pages held their own secrets. Defne gently greeted them.

“I found happiness in stillness,” the person said, eyes closed, voice soft.

For a while Defne sat there too, feeling peace settle in their chest. But soon their heart stirred again.
“This isn’t enough,” they thought.
“Sometimes I need to speak, to move, to share.”

And so they rose and continued.

On the fourth day, the river curved toward a cave. Without pause, Defne stepped inside. Their every footfall echoed, and stalactites dripped in the dim light. At the cave’s heart lay a smooth, glass‑like pool.

Peering in, Defne saw not only their reflection but scenes from the past:
Their muddy joy splashing through rain‑soaked puddles as a child…
The first bright smile shared with a friend…
The warmth of a heartfelt hug the first time they felt loved…

Tears filled their eyes, not from sorrow but at the familiarity of those moments.
“Happiness… sometimes it’s remembering,” they murmured.
“But remembering alone isn’t enough. You must live it again and again.”

Emerging from the cave, Defne’s hands no longer shook. Their heart felt both calm and alive.

On the fifth and final day, the river had dwindled to a few precious droplets. Yet ahead a light glowed, like sparks dancing among the rocks.

Defne hurried, scrambling over stones, digging at the earth. And there it was—the source.

It wasn’t a spring of water but a small stone holding countless tiny droplets, each a moment in time captured like water in amber.

Etched on its surface were the words:
“Happiness is not a place you find but a river flowing with you. When you pause, it pauses. When you remember, it shines. When you share, it multiplies.”

Defne cradled the stone close to their heart. In that instant the river began to flow again—this time not only through the land but within Defne’s own soul.

That day Defne learned:
Happiness is not a feeling but a journey.
And like a single drop carried along its current,
it remains light, precious, and meant to be shared.
