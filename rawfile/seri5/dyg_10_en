Defne and the Carnival of Emotions

Days had followed one another, seasons blended together, and in the Land of Emotions the breeze had grown familiar—sometimes sweeping down from Fear Mountain, sometimes crossing the River of Joy, other times winding through the trees of the Forest of Anger before dissolving into the stillness of the Lake of Curiosity.

One morning, however, the sky took on unusual hues. Not white. Not even blue. It shimmered in a color that danced between ten thousand shades of purple and the hush of pink, traced with threads of gold.

From every corner, drums began to beat—not joyful, not frightening, but vibrantly alive, like a single heartbeat echoing through the Land of Emotions. The Carnival of Emotions was about to begin.

This carnival was no ordinary festival. It belonged to no calendar. Its start time was never known. Its guest list was never announced. Yet one day, somewhere, anyone who had reached the end of their inner journey would receive an invitation.

That morning… Defne received one.

A butterfly appeared, its wings transparent, inscribed with three words:
“Come, if ready.”

But one cannot prepare for this carnival. It is not a celebration of masks—but a gathering where masks are removed. Not a spectacle to watch, but an experience to be.

As Defne set out, every step felt familiar, as if echoing past travels:
the thorny slopes of Fear Mountain,
the cool mists of the Clouds of Sadness,
the patient waiting on the Isle of Patience,
the twists of the Labyrinth of Wonder,
the freshly turned soil of the Garden of Courage…

All of it converged, and Defne was no longer just a traveler but a bearer of every feeling, every impression, every question unanswered.

Upon arriving at the carnival grounds, nothing met the eye—no colorful balloons, no towering tents, no bustling crowds. Only a round, cobblestoned square with an empty circle at its center and chairs all around, waiting for arrivals.

Then a door opened.

First came Fear, shrouded in grey, its steps hesitant yet determined. It seated itself and bowed its head—no one watched, but it was there.

Next came Joy—unblazing but with a soft glow in its eyes, as if carrying an unending smile. It sat beside Fear in quiet companionship.

Then Anger arrived—not red or black, but flickering like an ember. It took its seat in silence, for there was no need to roar.

Sadness entered, leaving damp footprints, yet did not weep. It simply sat with deep, respectful stillness.

Curiosity followed, notebook left behind; this time it captured everything in its gaze alone.

Patience arrived, walking in time with the slow passing of moments, ready to wait even if the carnival never started.

Wonder appeared with one eye open, one closed—prepared for anything without trying to solve it all.

Longing lifted its face to the sky, greeting the stars before coming to rest.

And finally, Courage entered, carrying a satchel from which a hand of soil still peeked.

Defne watched them all. Then, from the center of the circle, a light emerged: the carnival had truly begun. But there was no music, no dancing—only silence. And within that silence a voice rose.

Not from outside—from within Defne:

“I am Defne.
I exist with all my emotions.
I walked in fear.
I grew in sadness.
I learned in wonder.
I deepened in longing.
I believed in patience.
I found my limits through anger.
I came closer by curiosity.
I lost myself in love.
And at last…
I reached myself.”
Each emotion raised its head and met the gaze. In that instant, a flower bloomed in the circle’s center—not a rose or an orchid, but a blossom whose every petal embodied an emotion:
the shadow of Fear,
the light of Joy,
the flame of Anger,
the water of Sadness,
the root of Patience,
the branch of Curiosity,
the seed of Courage…

All united in a single flower.

Defne bent down, lifted it gently, and placed it against the heart.

On the return journey, the Land of Emotions looked the same—yet everything had changed. Each corner, each path, each stone felt like home to an emotion.

Defne was no longer a traveler but a keeper of this land.

From that day on, no date was ever set for the Carnival of Emotions, yet a whisper spread:

“When someone walks in tune with their emotions, the sky darkens,
a star appears,
and the carnival begins anew.”
