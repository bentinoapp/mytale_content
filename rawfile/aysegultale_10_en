Defne and the Big Surprise
One morning, Defne woke up rubbing their eyes. When they looked out the window, a brightly colored paper was taped to the glass. With sleepy eyes, they stood up and moved closer. The paper read:
“Are you ready, Defne? Today is the big surprise day! – Fluffy”

Defne’s eyes widened.
“Fluffy! Since when did you learn to write?”
They clutched their plush bear and rolled over in bed.
“This must be something mom and dad planned… But why?”

When Defne went downstairs, their mother was acting like it was just another normal morning in the kitchen, and their father was buried in the newspaper. However, a clue lay waiting on the table:
“First clue: A card is waiting for you under this toast!”

Defne immediately checked under the toast.
“Amazing! Now, go to the heart of the fridge.”
They ran over to the fridge and found a new card:
“Bravo! Don’t forget to check the mirror in the bathroom.”

When Defne entered the bathroom, they saw a giant smile drawn in bright red lipstick on the mirror. Beneath it, the message read:
“Today is a special day for someone special. But first, change your pajamas!”

Brimming with excitement, Defne dashed upstairs. Their heart fluttered with butterflies.
“What could this be preparing for, Fluffy? It’s not a birthday, and there’s no school…”
They put on their favorite yellow dress and clipped a little hairpin in their hair.
They even fastened Fluffy to their chair.
“You must look dashing too. Today is our day!”

Soon after, they headed out. They got into the car, yet no one had told them where they were going.
“This feels like a secret mission!” their father remarked.
“Today, your patience and imagination are being tested!”
While on the way, their mother started posing riddles:
— “It has eyes but cannot see, has pages but never speaks. What is it?”
— “A book!”
— “And what walks in the sky without taking a step?”
— “A cloud!”
Every time Defne solved a riddle, a bright smile spread across their face.

About twenty minutes later, they stopped at the edge of a forest. They got out of the car to find ropes tied to trees and colorful balloons hanging from them.
Tiny signs dangled from the rope, saying:
“You're on the right track.”
“Just a bit more patience…”
“Fluffy is watching you.”

They walked among the trees along a small trail until Defne could hardly believe their eyes. There, decorated with vibrant ribbons, stood a little cabin with a huge sign on its door:
“Welcome to the Dream Discovery Club!”

Defne froze, their heart pounding. When they opened the door, their eyes sparkled. Inside, there were bookshelves, a coloring corner, star maps, puppets, and most importantly, a book lying on a table titled:
“Defne’s 10 Amazing Stories”
It featured their very own name and illustrations.

Their mother smiled warmly.
“We kept every diary entry you wrote, every dream you shared. Now you have your very own storybook.”

With eyes brimming with tears, Defne whispered,
“Is this... real?”
Their father hugged them and said,
“You imagined it, and we only helped. This world was born from your pen.”

Just then, Ethan entered carrying a small package.
“This is also from us,” he said.
When Defne opened the package, they found a handmade, bound notebook. On it, the title read:
“Defne’s Future Dreams”
The first page carried these words:
“You are a writer of the heart, for your words warm others. Keep going, Defne!”

Defne embraced Ethan.
“You’re the best surprise of all!”
Ethan winked and replied,
“I’m just the messenger. The real gift is the world inside.”

The rest of the day felt like a dream.
There were activity tables for “Story Time,” “Fluffy’s Missions,” and “Dream Maps.”
Every child drew their own world on a big sheet of paper. Defne drew a giant sun with Fluffy, Ethan, and their family beneath it, writing:
“Every story that begins with a heart full of love reaches the stars.”

Then, a puppet show began. With characters like Fluffy and Dino, they performed their own stories.
Defne stood on stage and said,
“Sometimes the greatest surprise comes when we forget ourselves. I found myself again in these stories.”

When evening fell, the cabin’s lights slowly dimmed. As everyone gradually departed, Defne grew a little quiet and sat in front of the cabin.
“I wish time would stand still,” they murmured.
Their mother sat beside them.
“Time never stops, but it settles in your heart. You will always remember today.”

When they returned home, Defne immediately opened their diary and wrote:
“Today, I met myself. I saw what my stories taught me. There was a whole world outside, but an even bigger one hidden inside me. I painted that world with my dreams. And now I understand: Every child can be a book, and every book is a reflection of a heart.”

Defne hugged Fluffy close, closed their eyes, and whispered,
“Ten stories down… but you know what, Fluffy? This is just the beginning.”

And as Defne drifted off to sleep, they had already embarked on a new story—the infinite world within.
