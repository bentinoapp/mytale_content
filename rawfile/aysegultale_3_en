One morning, while Defne was looking out the window, a strange sound caught attention.
“Meow... meow...”
Turning their head, there was a tiny grey-and-white kitten hiding in the bushes of the apartment across the street. The kitten was meowing and glancing around with fearful eyes.

Defne immediately called out:
“Mom! There’s a little kitten in the garden. It looks so scared!”

Their mother looked out the window.
“Yes, a sweet little kitten. But it looks a bit dirty. Maybe it’s lost.”

Defne quickly made a decision. They ate breakfast quickly and packed a bottle of water, some cat food, and an old towel in their backpack.
“I’m going to be this kitten’s detective!” Defne said with determination.

When Defne got to the garden, the kitten was still there but hiding behind the bushes.
“Hello, little friend,” Defne said softly. “Don’t be scared, I’ll help you.”

They laid the towel on the ground and placed the food in front of the kitten. At first, it hesitated, but then gathered courage and started eating.
Defne slowly moved closer.
“Don’t worry... I just want to get to know you.”
The kitten gently raised its head, touched Defne’s hand, and began to purr.

When their mother came down to the garden, Defne was speaking excitedly:
“What should we name it, Mom? Maybe Fluffy?”
Their mother smiled:
“It’s a sweet name, but let’s try to find its owner first, okay?”

Defne took the role of “Lost Cat Detective” very seriously.
The next day after school, they posted little notes around the neighborhood:

“FOUND A KITTEN!
Small, grey-and-white, and super cute. If anyone is missing it, please contact Defne.”

They posted the note in the bakery, the corner store, and the park. They talked to neighbors and visited shops.
“Maybe a child lost it,” Defne said sadly.

That evening, Defne prepared a little box for the kitten in the garden. Inside, they placed the towel, water, and food.
“You can stay here tonight, little friend. But don’t worry—we won’t leave you alone.”

Throughout the night, Defne kept checking the window.
“Still there?”
Yes—Fluffy was sleeping inside the box.

The next day, Defne walked home with their friend Melis.
“Look, Melis, this is Fluffy. I found the kitten, but we don’t know who the owner is.”
Melis lovingly stroked the cat:
“Maybe it should be yours,” they said.
But Defne shook their head:
“No... someone might really miss them. I have to be patient.”

That day, Defne and their mom called the animal shelter. Had anyone reported a lost kitten matching Fluffy’s description?
No. No one had contacted them about it.

Still, Defne didn’t give up.
“Maybe the owner is elderly and doesn’t know what to do.”
Their mother gently patted their head:
“I’m so proud of your thoughtfulness, Defne.”

On the third day, while walking past the park, they saw a child crying with an elderly woman.
“Our kitty is gone... gone!” the child cried.
Defne immediately approached them.
“Excuse me, did you lose a kitten?”
The woman nodded:
“My grandchild’s kitten. We adopted it from the street when it was small. It’s been missing for four days.”

Defne’s eyes lit up:
“Was it grey-and-white? Did it have a small black ring on the tip of its tail?”
The child nodded quickly.
“Yes! That’s Fluffy! That’s my Fluffy!”

Defne called their mom right away. She arrived with the car, and together they brought the kitten from the garden. Even in the car, Fluffy was purring—like they knew they were going home.

When the doorbell rang, the child could hardly contain excitement.
The door opened, and the child embraced Fluffy tightly.
“I missed you so much,” they said, eyes full of tears.
Fluffy responded by purring and resting its head on the child’s shoulder.

Defne felt a little emotional but was happy.
“Now you’re home. You’re safe,” they said.

The woman turned to Defne:
“You’re a very special child. We won’t forget you. You truly gave your heart to this kitten.”

That day, Defne felt incredibly good. At home, they wrote a long note in their journal:
“Today, I healed someone’s heart. We found Fluffy’s home. I loved them very much, but true love sometimes means letting go. I can’t describe this feeling in words, but there’s a warm glow in my heart.”

That evening, their father surprised them:
“You know, there are still little kittens at the shelter waiting for a new home...”
Defne’s eyes widened:
“Really?”
Their mother smiled:
“Maybe your story is ready to start a new chapter there.”

That night, Defne whispered to the stars:
“Don’t worry, Fluffy. I’ll always remember you. And I’ll open my heart to new friends.”
