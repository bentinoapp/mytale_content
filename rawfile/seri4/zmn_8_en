Defne and the Pursuit of Time – Chapter 8: In Today’s World

This time the Time‑Hourglass behaved in a way unlike any before. The sand did not fall—it swirled and spun inside, as if uncertain where to go. Then the small display in its center glowed, and instead of a hand turning or a flash of light, a single word appeared:

“Now.”

Everything went blank—no light, no sound. In the next moment, Defne raised their head. Bright screens flickered all around, colored lights played across walls, people walked by, and small flying devices hovered overhead. The place felt crowded yet silent, as if each person inhabited a private bubble.

Automatic doors slid open. Digital buses rolled past. Electric bicycles buzzed by. Facial‑recognition kiosks scanned passersby. Machines moved everywhere, but almost everyone’s hands were buried in a pocket or swiping a small touchscreen.

At Defne’s side, a small self‑driving vehicle pulled up. Its door slid open on its own, revealing a sign:

Autonomous Taxi – Please state your destination

A calm voice issued from inside:

“Welcome, time traveler. Ready to explore today’s world? Please fasten your seatbelt.”

Defne took a seat and the door closed gently. The taxi glided forward. Outside, dynamic displays on the windows scrolled weather forecasts, traffic updates, daily headlines, even lists of this month’s most‑read books.

First stop: a school.

But this school was nothing like those of the past. Solar panels glittered in the courtyard; a rooftop garden grew fresh produce above. Inside, students worked at computers, some controlling robots via tablets. In one corner, three children studied the planets through augmented‑reality goggles.

A teacher approached with a welcoming smile:

“Today’s students learn to wield technology and live in harmony with nature. Here, lessons go beyond facts—they cover collaboration, critical thinking, and taking responsibility.”

Defne’s eyes widened. A group of students was building miniature solar‑powered vehicles, while another team assembled models of wind turbines from recycled materials. A poster on the wall declared:

“The Future Begins Today.”

Next stop: a hospital.

Inside, calm and order reigned. Doctors consulted patient records on interactive screens, robot arms performed delicate procedures, and a child received remote care via camera and microphone.

“This is tele‑medicine,” explained a staff member. “People in remote areas can get expert treatment. Technology brings not just convenience but real accessibility.”

Then: a virtual‑reality art exhibition.

Visitors donned VR headsets to explore digital galleries. Walls displayed interactive paintings whose colors shifted with each viewer’s expressions.

“Even art evolves with technology,” said the guide. “But emotions remain unchanged. Colors, melodies, lines—they still speak from heart to heart.”

At the end of the exhibit, Defne stepped into a small booth. Inside, a person wrote in mid‑air with a virtual pen; luminous letters hovered on an invisible canvas:

“When technology drowns out the voice of the heart, it is only noise. Used wisely, it becomes hope.”

On to the city center.

Towering screens on skyscrapers streamed news 24/7. Pedestrians moved swiftly, earbuds in place, yet no one collided. Everyone moved individually, yet somehow in unison.

In a corner of a park, a group had set up a simple table labeled “Sharing Box.” One person took a book; another left behind a toy.

An older passerby beckoned to Defne:

“Today’s world feels strange, doesn’t it? Everything moves so fast. And yet there are still those who share, who help, who listen, who create…”

Defne nodded, warmed by the sight of generosity amid the bustle.

Final stop: a research laboratory.

Scientists in white coats tended tiny plants in test tubes and experimented with extracting water from the air. A robot separated recyclables on command. Nearby, children debated:

“What should the cities of tomorrow look like?”

A mentor joined them:

“Our mission is not only to think about today but to care for tomorrow—and not only for people, but for the planet. Progress must honour nature.”

Defne approached an interactive display: a game titled “Reduce Your Carbon Footprint!” Points rewarded choices like clean energy, conserving water, and recycling. Defne played eagerly, yet reflection came, too: the world is fragile, and everyone carries responsibility.

The autonomous taxi returned. It waited silently, door open. Before stepping back in, Defne took a final look: glowing screens, conversing machines, sharing strangers, and burgeoning hopes…

The Time‑Hourglass trembled in Defne’s pocket. This time the sand settled into a steady, downward flow—because the journey was back to the present.

A warm light filled the space. Defne closed their eyes.

In the next instant, they found themselves in their own room.

The desk looked a little different. On it lay a notebook with a single QR code, beneath which read:

“The future belongs not to those who follow time, but to those who shape it.”

Defne walked to the window. Outside, a child tested a solar‑powered toy car. Birds glided overhead, and somewhere a bell gently rang. Everything was so familiar—and yet entirely new.

And the Time‑Hourglass was ready once more.

Because the next stop… was tomorrow.
