The Time Hourglass was silent.
No sand trickled, no light glowed, and no hands moved—as if the journey had ended. Defne didn’t know this yet; they sat at their desk staring at the still Hourglass, waiting for a sign. “Is that it?” they wondered. “Is it really over?”

A breeze drifted in through the window, lifting the curtain. The Hourglass on the desk trembled—and then, unexpectedly, the sand began to flow inward instead of downward. The casing started to rotate, and a hatch appeared at its center that no one had ever seen. From it came a single message:

“The heart of time awaits you.”

Instantly, everything lit up.

But this felt less like travel than like stepping through a doorway into something new. When Defne opened their eyes, they were neither in the past, the present, nor the future, but in a different realm altogether—a place untouched by time, where echoes took shape and thoughts became visible.

Though the space appeared empty, it contained everything: grains of sand, books, stars, melodies, flowers, whispers… Traces of every moment time had ever touched were present here.

Defne tried to ask, “Where am I?” but no sound came out. Almost the instant the question formed in their mind, a voice replied:

“This is the Heart of Time—the place where all beginnings converge and to which all things return.”

The voice had no visible source, yet it seemed to come from everywhere at once—soft, wise, and calm.

Defne took a step forward. The floor glowed beneath their foot. With each step, a new vision appeared:

First step: Cave walls covered in ancient paintings.

Second step: Pyramids rising beneath the Egyptian sun.

Third step: People walking along Roman streets.

Fourth step: Trumpet calls echoing through medieval castles.

Fifth step: The scent of roses drifting through palace gardens.

Sixth step: The clank of steam‑engine gears.

Seventh step: A jazz‑filled city street.

Eighth step: Bright screens, robots, modern classrooms.

Ninth step: Floating cities and stars in the sky.

And on the tenth step, at the very center of time itself, appeared a Clock unlike any other.

It had no hands, no glass face. Its body was made of stardust, its base woven from ancient book pages. At its center, symbols of every era merged—a fragment of stone, a quill tip, a rose petal, a steam‑engine cog, a radio wave, the glow of a screen, a beam of starlight…

When Defne approached, their heartbeat and the Clock’s gentle vibration synced in rhythm. Then the voice spoke again:

“You did more than travel through time. You carried time with you—gathering a piece from every age: knowledge, craft, voice, scent, hope, and responsibility. Now, we complete this Heart of Time with you.”

The Clock shrank to fit in Defne’s palm. As it settled into their hands, a warm glow spread to every fingertip.

Defne wondered, “What happens now?”

The voice answered:

“You will carry time forward. But this is not the end of your journey—for time is remembrance, and you have become one who remembers.”

Defne looked around. Everything glowed, yet nothing stood out. Past, future, and present had merged into a single drop. Time was no longer a river, but a heart—beating, living, remembering…

As Defne took one more step, the light enveloped them—and not only did their surroundings change, but their understanding did, too. They were no longer a mere observer of time, but its bearer.

When they opened their eyes again, they were in their own room. But it was no longer just a room—it was a museum, a library, a laboratory, a garden. On the shelves were souvenirs from every journey. On the desk stood not the old Hourglass but a radiant sphere, inside which sparks of time swirled.

On the wall hung a single, large message:

“It is not enough to travel time; one must understand it. Those who understand honor the past, safeguard the future, and live fully in the present.”

Defne walked to the window. Stars shone overhead—perhaps one had come from the Heart of Time. Perhaps time no longer lay outside, but within.

And in that moment, they felt the beginning of a journey that would never truly end.
