Defne and the Pursuit of Time – Chapter 4: A Castle in the Middle Ages

This time the sands in the Time‑Hourglass fell hesitantly—now drifting upward, now downward, as if searching for their course. With a deep, resonant hum, the hourglass began to turn to a new rhythm. Amid those shifting grains, Defne caught a faint gleam. The light was no longer golden but grayish, veiled in mist.

When Defne opened her eyes, she found herself sitting on a cold stone floor. The air was crisp. From a distance came the blast of trumpets, neighing of horses, and the clash of armor. Looking up, she saw she stood within a massive stone enclosure: thick walls, heavy wooden doors, and soaring towers—the very heart of a medieval castle.

Behind those ramparts, people bustled with purpose. Some bore supplies into the keep, others sharpened arrows, and still others carried long timber beams. A steward spotted Defne and offered a warm smile.

“Are you new here? If you wish to learn how our castle functions, come with me.”

Defne nodded and followed. They passed through oak portcullises into the inner bailey, where life brimmed in every corner. A baker kneaded dough by a hearth; a horse trainer guided foals across the courtyard; at the well, a child lowered a bucket.

“A castle is more than mere fortification,” the steward explained. “It’s a small town unto itself. Each person has a role, and by everyone’s effort, it stands strong.”

Just then a voice echoed down a wooden staircase: “The meeting in the library is about to begin!” Defne’s heart leapt—she had never imagined a castle might house a library.

They entered a chamber behind a heavy oak door at the end of a stone corridor. Shelves bulged with books and parchment scrolls. Around a central table sat scribes and scholars, quills poised above inkpots. One rose to speak:

“Today is a day of wisdom. The pen is sharper than the sword. Let us show our new friend how we safeguard knowledge.”

A clerk carefully unrolled an ancient manuscript. Drawings, symbols, and flowing script adorned its surface. Turning to Defne, the clerk said,

“This book records the passing months, the movement of stars, and the order of nature. By watching the night sky, we know the season. Knowledge is more than reading—it is seeing, understanding, and observing.”

Defne listened, enchanted. Time, she thought, here it’s measured not by clocks alone, but by the heavens.

As the meeting ended, activity swelled outside. Dusk had begun to fall, and in the great hall a feast was being prepared. Long tables in the courtyard groaned under loaves of bread, wheels of cheese, apples, cured meats, and steaming bowls of soup. Minstrels tuned their lutes and fiddles, while children twirled and danced.

Defne seated herself at a corner table, sipping broth. An elderly blacksmith with calloused hands and bright eyes joined her.

“A castle isn’t built from stone alone,” he said. “It’s wrought from labor, hope, and community. One person may lay a stone, another may drive a stake—but only together do we build a true fortress.”

At that moment, another trumpet call echoed from the battlements. A rider clattered through the gate, mud‑splattered but bearing a proud smile and a sheaf of parchments.

“A map!” someone shouted. “New maps have arrived!”

Chaos and excitement ensued. The rider handed the scrolls to the castle’s master cartographer, who unfurled them to reveal mountains, forests, rivers—every feature drawn in minute detail.

The cartographer turned to Defne. “Maps record the traces of time: roads, waterways, passes… They are not just geography but stories. Each route holds its own tale.”

As Defne traced those lines on parchment, she felt the past come alive—in stone, in stars, and on the maps themselves.

Night deepened, and torches flanked the ramparts. As the moon rose, townsfolk and guards alike ascended the tower steps. Defne climbed too, emerging onto the battlements where the wind whipped her hair and revealed the castle like a jewel under silver light.

An elder scholar joined her and whispered,
“Time is not merely days passing. Time is the walls we raise together, the bread we share, the books we write, the songs we play. Each is part of time’s tapestry.”

At that instant, the Time‑Hourglass in Defne’s pocket warmed once more. Its sands reversed, and that familiar glow kindled again.

Defne gazed down at the courtyard: a hand offering soup, a child lifted into a dance, laughter echoing among stone walls. The entire castle beat like a living heart to time’s rhythm.

The light enveloped her—and the homeward journey began.

In the next moment, Defne stood in her own room again. But something lay on her desk that wasn’t there before: a small, smooth stone etched with fine lettering:

“A castle is built in living.”

Defne smiled. The memory of stone ramparts, festive music, and starlit towers had been etched into her heart—and the Time‑Hourglass softly ticked, calling her toward the next adventure.
