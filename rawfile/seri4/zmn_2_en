Defne and the Pursuit of Time – Chapter 2: In the Shadow of the Egyptian Pyramids

One morning, as Defne examined an old clock in their room, one of its glowing hands suddenly shone brightly. The ticking hands seemed to offer an invitation: “Are you ready? We’re about to wind time backward!”

When Defne blinked, they found themselves no longer in their room but before fields of golden sand, under a blazing sun—and in the distance rose three colossal structures: the Pyramids! Each soared toward the sky like silent sentinels on the vast desert. Defne realized: they had arrived in Ancient Egypt.

They looked around. People in long white robes carried stones and ropes. Under the shade of a nearby tree sat an elderly scholar beside a roll of papyrus and a reed pen. Defne approached quietly; the scholar looked up and smiled.

“Greetings, time traveler,” the scholar said calmly. “It seems the heart of time has called you here. Feel free to ask whatever you wish to know.”

Defne hesitated, then asked, “Who built these giant pyramids? Why are they so enormous?”

The scholar nodded. “A good question,” they replied. “These pyramids are the tombs of our pharaohs. We prepare them both for this world and for eternal life. It takes years to build each one, with thousands laboring together.”

At that moment, a child hurried through the crowd, holding a stone tablet. “Master, I’ve brought the final plans!” they exclaimed.

The scholar took the tablet and examined it. “Excellent. This shows the inner structure of the pyramid. Time traveler, if you wish, you may join us inside to take a look.”

Defne’s heart fluttered at the thought. They eagerly nodded—and followed the scholar into the pyramid.

Inside, the air was cool. On the stone walls were hieroglyphs—pictorial scripts depicting gods in some panels, battle scenes in others. “These inscriptions record our history, our beliefs, and the tales of our kings,” the scholar explained.

As they walked, they paused before a stone door. The scholar touched it gently. “Behind this door lies the Pharaoh’s chamber. But before we enter, there are tasks to complete here.”

Defne asked, “What tasks?”

In a serious tone the scholar said, “Building the pyramid is not merely stacking stones. Everyone here has a role: architects draft the plans, stonemasons sculpt the blocks, laborers haul the stones, and scribes record every detail. And curious travelers like you carry this knowledge into the future.”

Suddenly a voice rang out: “The Nile flood begins!”

Everyone raced outside with joy. Defne followed. In the distance the Nile’s waters crested its banks and flooded the plains. Yet no one seemed afraid; on the contrary, they ran toward the river with vessels in hand, gathering the life‑giving water.

The scholar explained, “The Nile’s annual flood enriches our soil. It arrives each season, then recedes, leaving fertile silt behind. It brings life to our fields.”

Defne knew they would never forget this lesson: living in harmony with nature, the Nile’s rhythm guided everything.

Meanwhile, Defne watched a stone‑carrier in the throng. Bearing a heavy block on their back, the carrier marched on with determination. As Defne approached, their eyes met. The carrier said, “This stone is just one piece—but when all pieces come together, they form a pyramid. Small tasks build great dreams.”

Those words etched themselves into Defne’s mind.

As the sun sank and the sky turned golden, the pyramids cast long shadows. The scholar showed Defne one last marvel: at the pyramid’s apex lay a single stone. “We call this the Benben Stone. It marks the center and the cosmic order.”

Just then, Defne felt warmth in their pocket. The hourglass had begun its motion again. Its hands turned, and its light glittered once more.

The scholar spoke softly, “Time traveler, your journey home now calls. But remember: to know the future, one must learn from the past.”

Defne closed their eyes, heart pounding like the echo of distant sands.

In an instant, they stood again in their own room. Yet everything felt subtly changed. On the desk lay a scrap of papyrus inscribed in hieroglyphs:

“Small tasks build great dreams.”

Defne smiled. Feeling the warmth of Egypt’s sun and the Nile’s promise, they gazed out the window at the sky. The secrets of time still beckoned—and Defne would follow.
