Defne and the Pursuit of Time 

Chapter 1: Cave Paintings and the First People

Defne was browsing shelves packed with ancient tomes when an old hourglass placed right in the center caught their eye. The grains of sand were trickling down… but something was off. Suddenly the sand began to flow upward! Defne rubbed their eyes in disbelief—no, the sand really was rising. As the grains danced faster, a soft glow seeped from the top chamber of the hourglass.

The light enveloped Defne like a gentle caress through time… and everything began to spin. When they opened their eyes again, they were no longer standing before the bookshelf but at the edge of a vast forest. The air was crisp. The sky a perfect blue, alive with birdsong.

Defne paused, straining to hear. Parting the thick leaves, they spotted a band of people wearing animal-hide garments and carrying stone tools. They stood around a fire, some sharpening spears, others fashioning implements from huge animal bones. Defne realized at once: these were the very first humans.

A child noticed Defne and, without a hint of fear, approached, curiosity shining in their eyes. The child held out a hand. Defne hesitated, then offered theirs in return. Neither knew the other’s name, yet both smiled. The child then took Defne’s hand and led them toward the group.

The hunters had just returned with a large deer. Everyone was at work: some skinning it, some cleaning the bones, others dividing the meat. Seated apart was an elder, quietly tracing shapes on a stone wall.

Intrigued, Defne crept closer—and gasped. It was a cave painting!

On the wall were figures of long‑horned animals, people shooting arrows, and sun‑like symbols. Defne felt enchanted. The elder set aside their rock‑scraper and met Defne’s gaze.

“Pictures speak, though they have no words,” the elder said. “They preserve our past and our memories. One day, those who see them will know who we were.”

Inside, Defne thought, “I am watching. And I will understand.”

Then the elder crouched and sketched in the sand at their feet: a sun, an arrow, a deer, and a human figure. “The sun rises, the deer runs, the human tracks. Such is life.”

At that moment, other children picked up small stones and began to draw on the inner cave walls. They handed one to Defne. Hesitant at first, Defne soon joined in. Together they painted a massive deer and people running alongside. Every line buzzed with excitement; every dot told a story.

From outside came a deep rumble. The sky turned gray and thunder rolled. Rain began to pour. The people hurried into the cave and gathered around the fire. A young hunter tossed dry grass onto the flames. Smoke spiraled up to the ceiling. The elder rose and, in the hush, all listened.

The elder spoke again:

“Time is like a river. We are the stones on its bank. The river flows; we sometimes slip, sometimes stay. But one day, all will merge. Somewhere in the heavens beats the heart of time. Our stories guide us to that place.”

Hearing this, Defne finally understood why the hourglass had brought them here. These people were more than chapters in a history book—they were living, thinking, loving, drawing, and telling beings.

One child placed a small stone in Defne’s palm. “We call this a memory stone,” they said. “Whenever you wish to remember the past, hold it.”

The rain ceased. The clouds parted. The sun broke through again, casting long shadows and making the polished stones gleam. Defne felt the hourglass warm in their pocket as its grains reversed their flow—another gateway opening.

It was time to say farewell.

Defne waved gratefully to everyone, especially that first child. With one last look at the cave paintings—the voices of the past, the traces of time—they closed their eyes. The glow surrounded them once more.

When they opened their eyes again, they were back in their own room.

But something had changed.

On the desk lay a small stone—the very memory stone the child had given them—etched with a tiny deer.

Defne smiled. Their journey to the heart of time was just beginning.
