Defne and the Pursuit of Time – Chapter 3: A Day in Ancient Rome

The Time‑Hourglass ticked more slowly this time. Sand trickled at a gentler pace, as if whispering, “This journey will be different.” In the corner of Defne’s room, an old map seemed to stir, its curled edges faintly murmuring ancient inscriptions. When the last grain of sand fell, a burst of light spun the world anew—and Defne set off again toward the heart of time.

When Defne opened their eyes, they stood beside a wide, stone‑paved road. Ahead rose an impressive complex of towering marble columns, broad staircases, and gleaming statues. The sun was high, the sky a vivid blue—and they had arrived in Ancient Rome.

A voice rang out nearby: “Heading to the Forum? The crowd will be enormous today!”

Defne turned to see a companion draped in a simple fabric cloak and sandals, carrying a small woven basket. Defne smiled and nodded, curiosity guiding them onward.

The city teemed with life. Vendors hawked fruit, cloth, and fresh olives; philosophers held debates in shaded corners; children played games with stones on the pavement. Everywhere Defne looked, new faces and new sounds filled the air.

“This is Rome,” the companion explained. “One of the greatest cities of its time. Today the People’s Assembly meets—everyone is bound for the Forum.”

They followed the marble‑edged streets to a building inscribed Curia Julia. Inside, senators gathered: some spoke at the dais, others took notes. “This is the Senate,” the companion said. “Rome is governed here. Laws are made and justice is debated.”

Defne listened as one senator rose and proclaimed, “Justice is not only for the wealthy!” Another cried, “The voice of the people must be heard!” Defne felt inspired: here, ideas were spoken freely, and decisions shaped by many voices. “So that’s how governance works,” they thought. “It’s not just rules—the people matter.”

They walked on to a spacious plaza where a grand stone amphitheater stood: the Colosseum. Its arched walls and towering tiers filled Defne with awe. Yet the companion paused. “This hosts gladiatorial contests,” they said, “but now we shall visit the school.”

At a modest building nearby, Defne entered a hall lined with straw mats and wax tablets, each accompanied by a stylus. A young teacher spoke passionately to a circle of students:

“Today’s lesson is geometry. How do you draw a perfect circle? What is an angle? And why does a triangle’s interior angles always sum to 180 degrees?”

Defne sat on a mat as the teacher traced a circle in the wax. Then they asked, “When your mother gives you cloth at home, how would you measure it? Or if you wanted to make a wall straight, what would you do?”

One child raised a hand: “I would use a string.”
Another offered: “I would count paces with my feet.”

The teacher beamed: “Excellent! Mathematics is how we understand our world.”

Defne felt at ease among these lessons. As they listened, a young attendee whispered, “Come, I’ll show you the baths.”

Led by curiosity, Defne followed through vaulted corridors into a vast marble complex filled with steam. Bathers conversed as they soaked in warm pools.

“This is a Roman bath,” explained the guide. “Bathing is not just cleanliness, but social time, debate, and learning.”

In one corner, two players competed at a board game resembling chess; in another, a sculptor chipped away at a marble block. A reader then stood and recited a poem from a roll of papyrus:

“Stone rises, water flows,
Humanity passes, time observes.
One day all will fade away,
But ideas endure, flowing ever on.”

Defne etched those lines into memory—a whisper from within time itself.

As evening approached, the city took on a new hue. The sun turned crimson, shadows stretched, and streets grew quiet as families returned home.

The companion turned to Defne: “You’ve seen so much today. Remember this final truth: Rome’s greatness does not rest in its stones, but in its people. Every voice matters. Each block is hewn by a hand. Every wall is built together.”

At that moment, Defne felt warmth in their pocket—the hourglass had begun to flow backward again, its light rising once more.

“Time calls you back,” said the companion, “but do not forget Rome. Ideas outlive stone.”

The glow enveloped Defne, and the journey home began.

In a heartbeat, Defne was back in their room. On the desk lay a fragment of papyrus inscribed in faded hieroglyphs:

“An idea can last a thousand years.”

Defne smiled and gazed out the window. The stone avenues of Rome still lived in their heart. The heart of time still beat, inviting another adventure.
