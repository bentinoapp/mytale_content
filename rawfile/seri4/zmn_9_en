Defne and the Pursuit of Time – Chapter 9: A Day in the Future

The Time‑Hourglass behaved more strangely than ever. The sand froze, the hands stopped, and the lights dimmed. Everything sank into silence. Then, a previously unseen hatch in the middle of the Hourglass swung open, and a glimmer of sky‑blue and silver rose from within. The Hourglass seemed to whisper:

“Not to the end, but to eternity...”

In an instant, everything began to spin.

But this rotation was nothing like before. There was no wind, no sound—only a soft sense of nothingness. Then, eyes opened.

Defne found themself hovering near the sky. Transparent pathways floated all around, silent vehicles drifted by, and structures soared upward toward the clouds. The ground glowed with a blue light, people walked as if on air, and nature and technology wove together in a dreamlike harmony.

A sign blinked:

Year 2189 – Welcome to the World Central Time Zone

For a moment, Defne wondered if this was a dream. Then a stranger passed, smiling:

“Don’t worry—this is real. Time here is more than seconds; it’s a way of life. Come, let me show you the planet.”

As they walked, everything was silent yet complete. The sun’s warmth was tangible, birds still flew, trees still swayed—but each leaf carried data‑harvesting membranes, producing oxygen and information at once.

“We call these ‘Life Trees,’” the guide explained. “Their roots tap into underground knowledge networks. They nourish both nature and data simultaneously.”

A vast lagoon lay ahead. The fish within shimmered with metallic scales. A plaque read:

Self‑Cleaning Water Ecosystem – Zero Waste, Perfect Balance

Defne gazed in awe. Above, a floating structure that looked like a small planet drifted silently through the air.

“That’s a nomadic city,” said the guide. “People no longer abandon nature—they adapt to it. Cities now move with the wind, the sun, and the soil.”

They entered an elevator and rose to the top of a towering spire. At the summit stood a holographic globe dotted with hundreds of glowing points.

“Those are knowledge centers across the world,” the guide said. “Time here isn’t fixed. It flows differently everywhere. We unify it—gathering insights from the past, the present, and countless future possibilities.”

Suddenly the sky darkened—not in danger, but as a spectacle. Stars emerged, and a vast glass dome above slid open, revealing the cosmos. A group of children traced constellations with light‑wands.

“Welcome to the Time Observatory,” said the guide. “We no longer just observe stars—we learn from them and send messages to them. Each star marks another era; each beam of light carries an ancient memory.”

Defne stared into the celestial tapestry. The sky felt like a storybook.

Next, they descended into an underground passageway, utterly silent. Along the walls, holographic displays showcased cave murals, ancient garments, sound recordings, and even landmarks from Defne’s earlier journeys: pyramids, Roman roads, fortress towers, palace roses, steam engines, jazz melodies, digital screens, AI networks… all preserved together.

“This is the Time Archive,” the guide whispered. “To avoid forgetting the past, a fragment from every era is kept here. Societies that forget lose their direction. We find ours by honoring time.”

Defne’s gaze fixed on a display case. Inside lay a delicate object—a twin of the Time‑Hourglass, yet different. Inscribed on it was a single word:

“Remember.”

At that moment, a gentle alarm sounded—not a warning, but a summons. The guide bowed:

“The Time‑Hourglass calls you back. But there’s one last sight you must see.”

A door opened, revealing only a table. On it sat a transparent orb. Inside, tiny sparkles from all of Defne’s travels orbited: cave paintings, pharaonic relics, Roman roads, fortress parapets, palace flowers, steam‑engine cogs, jazz riffs, digital displays, AI patterns… all swirling within that glass sphere.

“This is the Heart of Time,” said the guide. “And now it needs your touch.”

Defne reached out and touched the orb.

In an instant, everything was bathed in light.

Back in their pocket, the Time‑Hourglass shone more brightly than ever. The sand no longer moved—it had come to rest. The journey was complete.

Light enveloped Defne.

And then…

They were back in their own room. But this time the space felt just a bit larger, more open, more meaningful. On the desk stood the Time‑Hourglass. Beside it lay a note:

“The future is not a place, but a choice.”

Defne looked out the window as a star blinked in the sky—perhaps a message, perhaps a reminder.

In that moment, Defne understood that this quest was not only about witnessing the past, but about imagining and shaping the future.
