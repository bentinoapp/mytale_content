Defne and the Dinosaur Who Wouldn’t Sleep

The sky was painted in purples and oranges, the birds were taking their final loops, and a gentle breeze caressed the leaves. Defne lay in bed, dressed in pajamas and clutching her teddy bear, yet sleep refused to come.

“Mom, can we read just one more book?” she called down the hallway.

Her mother entered with a smile. “We’ve read three books already, Defne. It’s time for sleep.”

“But I don’t feel sleepy at all!” Defne pouted.

Suddenly, a strange roar echoed from outside:
“GRRROOOOOHHHHH!”
Then another: “HUUUUNNNNGHHH!”

Defne’s eyes flew open. She bounded out of bed and rushed to the window. In the moonlit garden stood a huge, gray creature with a long neck.

“A dinosaur?” she whispered.

The moonlight danced on its broad back. Its tail thumped softly on the grass. Heart pounding with excitement and a hint of fear, Defne slipped on her slippers and crept outside.

The dinosaur froze at the sight of her, narrowed its eyes, then stepped back.

“Hello…” Defne ventured. “I’m Defne. Are you real?”

The dinosaur dipped its head. “I’m Bronto. And I’m here because… I don’t want to sleep!”

Defne blinked. “Me neither! But why don’t you want to?”

Bronto swung its massive head side to side. “There’s so much fun! Look at the stars, they’re sparkling. The wind is playing with the trees. I don’t want to miss any of it.”

Defne nodded. “Yes, the stars are beautiful… but if I don’t sleep, I’m so tired the next day. The other morning I even spilled my milk in my shoe at breakfast!”

Bronto’s eyes widened. “Spilled milk in your shoe? How does that happen?”

They both laughed.

Then Bronto settled beneath a tree. “But I’m a huge dinosaur. I don’t need sleep, do I?”

Defne sat beside him, teddy bear in hand. “Let’s think about that,” she said wisely. “Some scientists believe big dinosaurs rested at night too—some would lie down under trees, others would lean against them and doze on their feet.”

Bronto tilted his head. “Really?”

“Absolutely,” Defne said. “And there were even feathered dinosaurs that built nests and snuggled up inside to stay warm. Some say birds descended from those very dinosaurs!”

Bronto’s eyes went wide. “Feathers? Only birds have feathers, I thought.”

“Nope!” Defne exclaimed. “Scientists say birds are the descendants of dinosaurs. So some of your distant cousins might be flying overhead right now.”

Bronto gazed skyward. “If birds are my cousins, why can’t I fly?” he asked earnestly.

Defne laughed. “You don’t have wings, Bronto. But you have strong legs, a mighty tail, and the biggest heart.”

Blushing under his gray scales, Bronto lowered his head. “Thank you…”

They watched the sky together. Defne rubbed her eyes; Bronto stroked his vast belly.

“I think… I’m getting sleepy,” Bronto admitted. “But I don’t want to accept it.”

Defne scooted closer. “Sleep isn’t so bad. When we dream, we can fly as much as we like!”

Bronto’s eyes lit up. “Really? Do dinosaurs dream, do you think?”

“I bet they do,” Defne replied. “What would you dream about?”

Bronto lay down, curling his tail beside his head. “I’d dream of sunbathing by a lake… or racing a flying dino. Maybe discovering a lost world…”

Defne hugged her teddy tight. “I think I’ll dream of meeting you. Maybe tonight you’ll visit me in my dream.”

As Bronto’s eyes gently closed, he mumbled, “Okay. I’ll visit you in your dream.”

Defne stretched out on the grass. The stars glittered overhead. Gently, sleep enveloped them both. Under the moonlight, a human child and a dinosaur shared the same peaceful dream.

Defne’s Dinosaur Journal

Today I met a dinosaur named Brontosaurus, or “Bronto” for short.
He’s huge, but very gentle.
He eats plants.
With his long neck, he can reach leaves high in the trees.
Scientists believe some big dinosaurs rested at night—some lying under trees, others leaning against them.
Dinosaurs needed sleep, just like us!
