Defne and the Dinosaurs Go to School

The sun was shining brilliantly, but Defne’s heart felt cloudy.

She didn’t want to go to school today.

Yesterday in math class she’d scrambled her answer on the board. One friend laughed, another rolled their eyes.

When her mother handed her the backpack, she’d said, “Come on, sweetie—today’s a brand‑new day.”
But Defne murmured, “I wish everyone at school could be kinder…”

The moment she got home, she threw her bag aside, grabbed her teddy bear, and ran into the forest. She needed to talk to the dinosaurs.

By the big rock, Bronto, Rini, and Taran were already gathered—but something was off. Taran was tracing shapes in the dirt with his tail, Rini was fussing over her feathers, and Bronto stared thoughtfully at the sky.

“What’s going on?” Defne asked.

Bronto sighed.
“I’m so sad. We wanted to talk about dinosaur school… but we never went to school ourselves.”

Defne stopped in her tracks.
“Never?”

Rini nodded.
“We hatched from eggs, then had to learn to survive on our own.”

Taran rumbled softly,
“And sometimes… we learned the wrong things. And there were some things we never learned at all.”

Defne’s eyes lit up.
“Wait a minute… Then why don’t we start a school now?!”

Bronto blinked.
“How do you mean—for dinosaurs?”

“Yes! A Dinosaur School! It doesn’t matter if we can’t read or write yet. All we need is curiosity!”

The Next Morning
Defne made a big sign:
Dinosaur School—Knowledge Is Good for Every Creature!
In smaller letters beneath:
Lesson #1: How We Learn Together

In a clearing they set up a classroom‑like area:

Bronto lined up logs for seats.
Taran draped giant leaves as a roof.
Rini scratched out a “blackboard” in the dirt.
The First Day
Six more dinosaurs arrived: the three Triceratops siblings, a long‑necked Diplodocus, a shy Pachycephalosaurus, and a bouncy Velociraptor. All waited expectantly.

Defne stood before them.
“Today we will learn together. We are all different—and that’s wonderful.”

Bronto stood up.
“I want to count numbers!”

Defne placed stones on the ground.
“Okay, Bronto—let’s assign each stone a number.”

Bronto began,
“One… two… five… seven… thirteen…”

Rini burst out laughing.
“Aren’t you missing some in between, Bronto?”

Bronto lowered his head in embarrassment.

Defne intervened gently.
“Rini, here we don’t make fun of each other, right?”

Rini bowed her head.
“You’re right. I’m sorry, Bronto.”

Bronto beamed.
“Learning can be slow—but it’s so much fun!”

Next it was Taran’s turn.
“I want to learn map‑reading.”

Defne picked a large leaf and drew a tiny forest map in the dirt.
“We’re here. Now show us the path behind those brambles.”

Taran studied carefully, then tapped his nose:
“See that stone? It’s on my path. That must be the right way!”

Defne applauded.
“Amazing! You have such a strong sense of direction.”

When it was the Pachycephalosaurus’s turn, she hesitated.

“What would you like to learn?” Defne asked.

“I… I want to learn how to speak up. But I’m scared,” she whispered.

Defne stepped closer.
“It’s okay to just listen today. Just being here is wonderful.”

Lunchtime
Defne handed out fruit to everyone:

Bronto got grapes,
Rini blackberries,
Taran a marrow‑filled bone.
They ate in respectful silence. It was the first time such different dinosaurs sat together, and no one tried to outdo another.

Lesson Two
Defne wrote on her dirt‑blackboard:
Why Is Asking Questions Important?

Rini raised her hand.
“Why does the sky sometimes glow pink?”

Taran asked,
“Why do I always feel so alone?”

Bronto wondered,
“Why do hatchlings all look different?”

The Velociraptor piped up,
“Why am I so fast but can’t sit still?”

Defne’s eyes sparkled as she answered:
“Asking questions is how our hearts speak their curiosity. It’s the first step to learning.”

By the Weekend
They threw a “Little Dinosaurs’ Day” party for the newly hatched chicks.

Bronto taught them to count.
Rini organized a running race.
Taran showed them safe paths on the little forest map.
Defne sat back, smiling.
“This is what school really is,” she thought.
“A place where differences meet, we learn together, and nobody judges.”

As evening fell and everyone dispersed, Taran quietly approached Defne.
“Defne…”

“Yes?”

“For the first time… I felt I belonged. Thank you.”

Defne reached out her hand.
“You always belonged here, Taran. You just needed someone to choose to see you.”

As stars appeared overhead, Defne hugged her teddy and penned one last entry:

Defne’s Dinosaur Journal

Today we founded a school—with no desks, bells, or desks.
Dinosaurs of all kinds attended: Bronto, Rini, Taran, and new friends.
Each dinosaur has strengths in one area and is eager to learn in another.
The quiet ones asked the best questions.
The frightening ones drew the safest paths.
The fastest ones learned to wait for others.
Knowledge lives not only in books, but also in hearts, in shared glances, and in patience.
