Defne and the Missing Eggs

The sun had not yet fully risen. The sky wore a hue between gray and pink, and birds were slowly waking up. Defne found herself in a dream: she was standing beside a dinosaur nest filled with colorful eggs—one spotted green, another striped yellow, even one with a purplish tint…

Just as she reached out to pick one up, all the eggs vanished. She woke with a start, her heart pounding. Was it just a dream—or a warning?

Defne changed into her day clothes, tucked her teddy into her backpack, and slipped outside without waking her mother. “Something’s going to happen today,” she thought.

She hurried to the big rock where she met Bronto each morning—and saw him pacing anxiously. His great feet rustled the soil; he breathed loudly through his nostrils. She had never seen her gentle Bronto so panicked.

“Bronto, what’s wrong?” she asked, worry in her voice.

Bronto turned to her with wide eyes. “My eggs… they’re gone!”

“What? How do you mean?”

“This morning I woke up and my nest was empty. Last night there were seven. They were all buried in the ground, hidden away. Now… not one remains!”

Defne pulled out her notebook and a magnifying glass, ready to investigate like a young scientist. “Let’s examine the nest,” she said. “Show me where it was.”

Bronto led her to the old nesting spot. The earth was evened out, as if the soil had been dug up and then smoothed over.

Defne crouched down and studied the ground with her fingers. There were no claw marks—no footprints at all. But…

“Here!” she whispered, excitement in her voice. “A sliding track!”

A thin, winding trail in the soil—like something had slithered belly-first.

Bronto sniffed the air. “That trail… I don’t recognize it.”

Defne nodded. “Let’s follow it. It might lead to the eggs.”

They trailed the track into the forest. The trees grew denser and the air cooled. Amid the birdcalls, they heard leaves rustling. Bronto panted, while Defne forged ahead, peering through her magnifier.

Half an hour later, behind some bushes, they spotted a faintly glimmering round object.

One egg!

Bronto rushed forward—but Defne held up a hand. “Careful! There might be danger nearby.”

A tiny voice squeaked from the undergrowth: “I didn’t steal them! Really, I didn’t!”

Out stepped a small, feathered dinosaur, its eyes enormous and its plumage bristling. It looked frightened, yet determined.

“Who are you?” Defne asked gently.

“I’m Rini—an Oviraptor,” the little dinosaur said.

Bronto’s eyes narrowed. “An Oviraptor? That’s… an egg‑thief!”

Rini bowed its head. “I’m no thief. That name was given by mistake. I just… wanted to keep the eggs safe.”

Defne stepped closer. “What do you mean?”

Rini explained: “Last night, a Tyrannosaurus was roaming nearby. It must have caught the scent of the nest. I didn’t want the eggs to be eaten, so I quickly gathered them up and hid them in different spots.”

Defne considered this. “That makes sense. A T‑rex is a predator, and eggs are an easy snack for it.”

Bronto’s expression softened. “But why didn’t you tell me?”

“You were asleep so soundly,” Rini said. “I was scared. I only wanted to help.”

Defne examined the recovered egg—it was spotless, not a crack in sight. Rini had handled them with care.

Bronto lowered his head. “I’m sorry, Rini. I accused you too quickly. You were brave.”

Rini wagged its tail. “Shall we find the rest together?”

So the three of them set off, hunting for eggs scattered through the forest. One lay in a hollow, another beneath a leaf pile, some tucked behind rocks. Defne recorded each discovery in her notebook—its color, pattern, and hiding place.

By the time they found the seventh egg, dusk was falling. They returned to the original nest site.

Defne lined the nest with soft grasses and moss. She reshaped the earth around it and built a low stone wall. Finally, she laid large leaves over the top to camouflage it.

Bronto’s voice trembled. “If it weren’t for both of you, I would have lost them forever.”

Rini brushed gently against Defne’s leg. “I learned today what true friendship means.”

That evening, as Defne headed home, she looked up at the twinkling stars. In her mind’s eye she saw those seven eggs safe in their nest—and tiny hatchlings peeking out, their big eyes sparkling as they scampered after her in her dreams.

Defne’s Dinosaur Journal

Species I met today: Oviraptor
The name means “egg‑thief,” but that’s a misunderstanding.
Scientists discovered some Oviraptor fossils atop nests—evidence they were protecting, not stealing, their eggs.
They had feathers!
Though small, they were quick and agile.
Dinosaurs, like us, loved and cared for their young.
