Defne and the Roaring T‑Rex

The sky was tinged with grey, and the wind rustled the treetops. When Defne opened her eyes that morning, she felt a strange weight in her chest—like the echo of a roar from the night sky had reached her ears.

“Was that in a dream?” she wondered. Holding her teddy bear tight, she whispered, “Something big is going to happen.”

She grabbed her backpack, brushed off her mother’s surprised “Where are you going?” with a grin, and headed into the forest.

At the familiar meeting rock, she found Bronto pacing anxiously, his massive body shifting back and forth, tail thumping the ground. Rini was hiding behind a bristly bush, only the tips of her feathers visible.

“Good morning!” Defne called cheerfully, but something felt off. “What’s wrong? Why are you so quiet?”

Bronto grunted.
“Last night… the T‑Rex…”

“What happened to the T‑Rex?”

Rini peeked out from behind the thicket.
“I saw it!”

Bronto lurched back.
“You… saw it?!”

Rini nodded.
“Yes. In the dark… its huge teeth… its tail smashing stones. It roared—a roar so powerful, the ground trembled.”

Defne frowned.
“Did it chase anyone? Attack?”

“No,” Rini replied, “but the sound alone was enough for me to run!”

Bronto stamped a foot.
“It might be watching us now. It might… choose one of us.”

“Choose us?”

Bronto went silent.
“Like we’re breakfast…”

Defne thought for a moment. Yes, a T‑Rex was enormous and terrifying. But were all of them really bad?

She stood tall.
“We can’t decide without knowing more. Let’s go to the western clearing. Maybe it left tracks.”

They crept deeper into the western woods. The birds suddenly fell silent; the wind seemed to shift. On the ground they found deep claw marks, and gashes on tree bark.

“Look,” said Defne. “This claw span is almost 40 centimeters!”

Bronto shivered.
“Bigger than even me.”

Rini pricked her ears.
“It’s a giant, the biggest predator of all.”

At last they reached the clearing—and there, in the shadows, stood a figure.

The T‑Rex.

Its massive head hung low, muscles rippling along its back, tail curved like a half‑moon. Its body trembled—but remained utterly still.

Bronto recoiled.
“Let’s go!”

Rini dashed behind Defne.

But Defne stepped forward. Her heart pounded, but her eyes were steady.
“T‑Rex!” she called. “Why are you here?”

The colossal head lifted. Their eyes met.

Defne expected feral fury, but saw only weariness… and a single tear.

The T‑Rex spoke.
“Do not approach. You’ll fear me.”

Defne was gentle.
“Fear is natural. But I won’t judge until I understand.”

The T‑Rex narrowed its eyes.
“I am Taran. They abandoned me… because I roar too loudly. Because my teeth are immense. I only… wanted someone to talk to.”

Bronto crept nearer.
“You just wanted company?”

Taran nodded.
“My tail got trapped last night. I roared—but everyone fled. I only needed help.”

Defne’s eyes widened. She knelt and approached the tail. Sure enough, a huge rock was pinning it.

“Does it hurt?” she asked.

Taran gave a low whine.
“A lot.”

Defne quickly made a plan.
“Rini, keep watch. Bronto, push the rock from that side. I’ll dig under the other.”

Rini climbed a tree for lookout. Bronto heaved with all his might. Defne began to scoop away earth. After hours of effort, the rock finally budged.

TARAN LET OUT A ROAR—
RAAAAWWWWWRRRRR!

But this roar was not of anger; it was relief.

Taran lifted his head to the sky.
“Thank you… truly… thank you.”

Defne smiled.
“Why didn’t you tell us sooner?”

Taran closed his eyes.
“Because no one would believe me. They see only giant teeth and loud roars.”

Bronto stepped forward.
“I think we judged you wrongly.”

Rini wagged her tail.
“Often, the one we fear most needs our help.”

Defne stood tall.
“Sometimes behind the loudest roar hides the loneliest heart.”

From that day on, Taran was no longer feared but welcomed as a friend of the forest. It took him a while to learn to roar gently, of course…

Bronto invited him daily to show off his nest. Rini grew used to perching on his back. And Defne wrote one last entry in her notebook:

Defne’s Dinosaur Journal

Species met today: Tyrannosaurus rex (T‑Rex)
Carnivorous and powerful.
Roughly 12 meters long.
Teeth up to 20 centimeters!
Short arms but a mighty jaw.
Most importantly: even a T‑Rex feels emotion.
A fearsome appearance does not mean a lonely soul cannot need a friend.
