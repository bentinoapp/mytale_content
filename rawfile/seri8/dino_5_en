Defne and the Flying Giant: Pteranodon

It was a thunderous night.
The wind rattled the window, and raindrops drummed against the glass.
Defne was buried under her blanket, clutching her teddy bear tightly.

When she closed her eyes, she suddenly found herself soaring in the sky.
She drifted among the clouds, the wind whipping her hair—
and beside her flew a gigantic shadow: a Pteranodon!

But the wind shifted.
Its wings trembled.
Defne was thrown off balance and began to fall…

“Aaaaa!”

She awoke with a start, heart pounding.
Her hands pressed against her chest.

“What a terrifying dream…
Can flying really be so scary?”

The next morning, Defne still thought about that dream.
At breakfast, her mother said, “You didn’t finish your egg.”
But Defne stared out the window.

“How do flying dinosaurs stay balanced?
Won’t the wind blow them down?
Don’t their wings get tired?”

She tucked her teddy into her backpack and hurried into the woods.
Today, she must find the answers.

In the familiar clearing, Bronto, Rini, and Taran were waiting—
along with one more figure.
Tall‑beaked, deep‑eyed, wings unfolding in the breeze:

Tur the Pteranodon.

Defne’s jaw dropped.
Tur stood on a rock, feathers splayed to the wind.

Bronto explained excitedly,
“This is Tur—the guardian of the skies. He soars higher than any of us.”

Defne approached with wonder.
“Hello, Tur. I’m Defne.”

Tur inclined his head.
“Greetings, friend of the wind—Defne.”

Defne gave a small smile.
“I flew with you in my dream, but I fell and woke up. I was so frightened.”

Tur raised an eyebrow.
“So you felt the wind’s balance… and its power.”

At that moment, Bronto thumped his tail on the ground.
“Come on! Today’s Tur’s great flight day!”

Taran interjected,
“Yes, but Tur seems nervous.”

Rini murmured,
“They say the wind at the mountaintop is fierce, with sudden gusts.”

Tur bowed his head.
“I must make an important crossing today. My friends await on the other side of the mountain. But the winds are fickle—and… I feel a tremor inside me.”

Defne sat quietly beside him.
“You know, fear is often where courage begins. I was afraid too—but talking to you gives me courage.”

Tur was silent for a long moment.
Then he slowly spread his wings and looked skyward.

“Let’s try.”

Friends prepared the viewing area at the edge of the clearing:

Rini gathered sturdy branches,
Bronto straightened the underbrush,
Taran laid out stones as wind‑direction markers.
Tur climbed onto the rock.
The wind buffeted his face.
He closed his eyes and drew a deep breath.

“The sky calls to me…”

And he flapped his wings.

At first he wavered—
then, in a graceful glide, he lifted off!

Tur rose.
Higher and higher,
above the clouds.

Defne waved excitedly.
Bronto squinted up at him.
Taran sniffed the breeze.

Suddenly Rini cried out,
“Something’s falling!”

High above, a tiny shape tumbled.
A baby pterosaur!

Defne whipped out her binoculars.
“He hasn’t learned to fly yet—help him!”

Tur darted into action,
wingbeats driving him downward.
The wind was strong, but his purpose was stronger.

As the baby neared the ground, Tur accelerated—
and at the last moment…

ZAAAPP!

He caught the young one!

The clearing erupted in cheers.
Rini hopped up and down; Taran tapped out a rhythm with his tail.

Tur landed gently and set the baby down.
The little pterosaur blinked up at him.

“I… I was falling… but you came…”

Tur bowed his head.
“I was scared too. But seeing you… I wasn’t afraid anymore.”

That night, Defne gazed up at the sky.
The moon was perfectly round.
Stars shimmered.
And high above, a silhouette soared:

Tur.

He was no longer just guardian of the skies—
he was a hero in her heart.

Defne’s Dinosaur Journal

Today’s flying friend: Pteranodon
Not a dinosaur, but a pterosaur (flying reptile).
Wingspan can reach 5–7 meters.
Toothless; uses its long beak to catch fish.
Soars using air currents with expert balance.
Its cranial crest helps with stability in flight.
Though the sky is its home… even it feels fear sometimes.
And true courage is flying despite that fear.
