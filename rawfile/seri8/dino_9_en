Defne and the Egg to Protect

That morning, while having breakfast by her window, Defne noticed the clouds forming the shape of a dinosaur. “This can’t be a coincidence,” she thought. She grabbed her adventure gear—her notebook, pencil, magnifying glass, and a handful of nuts—and headed out, certain an adventure awaited.

On her way to the museum, Defne felt a strange pull, as if something were calling her. She climbed the silent stone stairs and turned into the fossil gallery corner, where a new display was set up: Dinosaur Eggs and Care Techniques.

Just as she bent to read the panel, her vision swam, the floor shook, and everything changed.

When she opened her eyes, she stood on a grassy plain at a cliff’s edge, the sun low in the sky. Beside a large boulder lay a cracking egg, from which came a high, desperate peep—the hatchling was about to break free. Yet the forest was eerily silent; even the birds had gone quiet.

Suddenly two gleaming eyes watched her from the undergrowth: a small but cunning Troodon, clearly aiming for the egg.

Defne held its gaze and stepped in front of the egg.
“This egg is not alone,” she called firmly.

The Troodon paused, then crouched but did not back away.

A deep voice rumbled behind her:
“And what are you doing here, little human?”

A towering figure emerged from shadow: Maiasaura, the “Good Mother Dinosaur” known for tending her eggs.

Defne stood tall.
“I was protecting this egg. A Troodon tried to snatch it.”

Maiasaura sniffed at the egg and exhaled.
“It may not be mine, but it came from an abandoned nest. We must guard it together—abandoned eggs don’t survive long here.”

Defne quickly jotted notes:

Maiasaura is one of the dinosaurs that cares for its hatchlings.
Abandoned eggs either fail to hatch or fall prey to predators.
Overhead, clouds rolled in and distant thunder rumbled. The air pressure rose. Maiasaura lifted her snout.
“A storm is coming. We must move the egg—leaving it here is too dangerous.”
Defne thought for a moment, then remembered something from the museum:
“Some dinosaurs carried their eggs to safer ground instead of leaving the nest behind.”
Maiasaura nodded.
“Follow me.”

Troodon’s eyes glinted from the brush as they hurried along. Rain began to lash down, turning soil to mud. Defne gathered large leaves, dry grasses, and a bark fragment, wrapping the egg carefully. They reached a rocky outcrop.

“This spot will hold. The rocks will shield us from the wind, and runoff won’t flood here.”
Defne placed the egg in a secure nook while Maiasaura curled protectively over it.

Suddenly came a cracking sound: Crack!

Defne’s eyes widened as the shell split. A tiny, wet beak emerged, followed by bright eyes and delicate claws—an Oviraptor hatchling!

Though Oviraptors once earned the name “egg thieves,” they’re devoted parents. Defne realized the truth:
“It’s lost its mother,” she whispered.

The hatchling reached out toward Defne’s finger, then pressed against Maiasaura’s side. Maiasaura gently wrapped her body around it.
“I will be its mother,” she said softly.

Defne wiped her eyes. The storm had passed, Troodon had slunk away, and a rainbow arched overhead. For a moment, the world felt more beautiful than ever.

Defne’s Dinosaur Journal
Today I protected an abandoned dinosaur egg. The hatchling was an Oviraptor—misnamed “egg thief” but actually devoted to its young. Maiasaura is among the species that nurture their offspring. No matter how different species may be, compassion is universal. Eggs are more than shells; they hold hope, life, and possibility.

I learned that sometimes being a mother or guardian to another is the most heroic act of all.
